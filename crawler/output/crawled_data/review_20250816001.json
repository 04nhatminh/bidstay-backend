          "comments": "This was a lovely farm stay about an hour drive outside of Da Lat. The host was kind enough to offer transport from Da Lat because the farm is hard to access via grab etc. The view was absolutely breathtaking and the room was perfect for what we needed - can cook simple meals in the kitchenette. The host offered us fresh fruit and avocado smoothies for free as well as did our laundry for us. They also offer home cooked meals per request and they made some of the best chicken wings I‚Äôve ever had. I highly recommend this stay for a peaceful getaway from the city."

It is quite far out from the city, but for a peaceful getaway, this is the perfect choice. I wish we had more time in the farmstay but unfortunately we were only in Dalat for 1 night. Everyone was so nice and friendly. The host‚Äôs sister was very welcoming and hospitable, she brought us out to a place where we could do a head spa since we wanted a massage and she even got us coconuts!"

It is relatively isolated which is nice but it is also a farm‚Ä¶and that means the whole package of doggies barking and people coming and going‚Ä¶it‚Äôs realistic, not a pampered escape into nature. <br/>The views from the room are breathtaking, and I want to be adopted by the family. Everyone is so friendly and thoughtful. An unforgettable stay. I will be back!"

Full size fridge. They did have a bbq that was on coals. On request. Stoke your own fire. Super awesome. They have mopeds to rent. It‚Äôs a short trip down the hill to the market. Groceries. Coffee shops. Etc. there are a few beautiful waterfalls to check out and a monastery that‚Äôs definitely worth a look. Highly recommended. <br/>Although you are on a farm way out there. Be prepared for heavy rains, and some serious mozy‚Äôs. Bed has a nice mozzy net so you can sleep peacefully. <br/>Oh and the view is amazing !!"

It wasn't even a proper rental (shared when others needed it, and in poor condition) but we were charged 720,000 VND for it, which felt very unfair.<br/>A 100,000 VND \"caf√©\" charge showed up too, we were never told there was a cost nd we heard previous guests hadn‚Äôt been charged for it.<br/>It‚Äôs a shame, because we loved the place and the people, but the surprise bill and unreasonable bike charge left a bad taste. <br/>Future guests should be aware of this and ask about prices."

The very best about a great stay was the company - we had an amazing time communicating via translate, laughing and eating delicious food. When we had a hard time getting the scooter we borrowed down a steep hill, we instantly got help into easier terrain. Recommend for anyone who is willing to stay a bit out of the way.

I was worried about communication but that was a breeze because one, there wasn't much need for it and two they used the translation app which was great. Once I had to change my plans for the day and get back earlier due to heavy rain - I was in Da Lat during peak rainy season - and asked Quynh if there were any places nearby to get some lunch. Within 30 mins there was a gorgeous platter of 3 course home cooked meal! <br/>I had a great experience and will recommend this place to others."

Definitely a place to stay if you want to escape the busy city. <br/>They also invite you to have food with them and talk with them which leads to such an authentic experience. 1000/10 would recommend. <br/>We only wish we could have stayed longer but unfortunately they were booked out for the rest of dates we wanted to stay , and I see why they are booked out! <br/>If your thinking of staying in this area don‚Äôt look any where else you won‚Äôt regret staying here. My only advice is even tho they cook food for you , bring snacks or other foods you would want to eat as it‚Äôs quite far from local shops or restaurants, they have a hob cooker you can use in the room if you wanted to cook for your self."

Their warmth and hospitality were unmatched, and I truly felt at home. it‚Äôs the host‚Äôs family that made my time staying there unforgettable. <br/>the property has spectacular view to watch sunset and sunrise. if you love nature, It is a perfect location to get away from busy city for relaxation. in addition, there are 2 dogs and 2 cats on the property that will come to say hi and follow you around.  i was lucky to be able to stay at the farm on New Year time, where i learned how to make new year‚Äôs cake and watched¬†incredible firework display¬†from the backyard with the host‚Äôs family and fellows that also stay at the farm. i‚Äôm grateful to be able to get invited to experience many traditional things while staying here.<br/>If you‚Äôre looking for a place with a¬†breathtaking view, a welcoming atmosphere, and hosts who treat you like family, this is it."

Even though we spoke different languages, the google translate conversations were nice.  And also time spent with smiles and quietly being are sometimes the most profound communications. <br/>The two family dogs are always ready to be your friend at meal time, and if they get to know you, will even stop by to say hello just to be friendly!  Since I didn‚Äôt want to drive a motorbike in the mountains, a neighbor and one of the family members took me to a waterfall nearby one day.  And we even made maki rolls which was fun!  <br/>If you want some peace and quiet, time to yourself to sit and be, with lovely people around, in a nice comfortable room with amazing views in nature, I highly recommend this spot!"

Tons of ants in the bathroom, a cute frog üê∏, some lizards).<br/>But the host was super responsive throughout, offered solutions in the sense of moving to one of his other apartments, refunded a hefty amount of the price and was friendly and thoughtful on every interaction.<br/>Overall we had a great stay in this beautiful location, made a ton of great memories."

When I woke up early in the morning and looked out the window at a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds waiting for me, this was a moment that I will remember forever. Besides, the owner supported us very enthusiastically, giving us specific instructions to find a house. The path is not difficult but a bit steep, but when I reach the place where I can see the whole city in the distance, I find it completely reasonable. There are many restaurants about 3km from where we live, but if you are lazy and don't want to go anywhere, there are people who can buy food for you (for a fee)."

Everything is clean, aesthestic with basic amenties that should make you feel right at home. The location is the cherry on top as you are a few steps away from markets and cafes, a good centre place before getting start on your Dalat trip. The host is also passionate, friendly and very supportive with my requests, and I will be looking forward to stay here again next time."

His  restaurant also had great fresh food and amazing drinks when we had the privilege to dine in because of the rain.  We ended up extending our stay there because of the whole experience.  Co Tam was also super nice!  Visit and enjoy."

Nonetheless, would first like to highlight that host was very responsive and the room had beautiful views of Dalat. We also received complementary yogurt :) Now to the reasons for this rating.<br/>We got our room swopped from this to room 4.2 when we arrived as they informed us that 4.1 was still being cleaned. That was still ok as it was kinda an upgrade to having 2 queen beds. However, upon entering, the room smelled musty and the floor was still wet (perhaps from cleaning). <br/>The water pressure and temp was finicky, in order to get hot water you‚Äôd have to lower the pressure, causing water flow to be small. The toilet also constantly smelled stale despite opening the window. <br/>The biggest reason why we gave a low rating was the bed had a lot of small bugs, resulting in a lot of bites. We tried to kill what we could but they somehow kept coming back. Hence the hygiene is questionble.. :("

Amazing, views are to die for.<br/>Toilet is kinda small (I'm plus sized) but it gets the job done.<br/>It can get warm in the noon but the fan provided helped alot.<br/>Location: Decently good with food spots and cafes around. Closer to the lake/central than it seems.<br/>Insects - Room was clear of insects just maybe a few tiny ones. When you chill at the balcony, there will be but hey you are in Da Lat so don't complain bout this.<br/>One thing for certain is that you will enjoy your stay. Host has a convenience store and a restaurant in the building so it really helped when you just wanna stay in and not go out.<br/>I will definately be back!"

She was proactive and responsive and went above and beyond. Her staff on site were also excellent. <br/>Best experience I‚Äôve had with a rental through airbnb. If you are considering a place like this, I would totally recommend it. We will be back again for sure."

Reason two is something that comes close to my heart.<br/>if you're an animal lover, don't come here. she keeps baby monkeys in small cages as some kind of entertainment. When I said this is not the kind of toerism I wanna support, she says she has a permit to keep the monkeys. I am sure you have, but you should know better. Other asian countries already made this illegal and Vietnam is walking behind.<br/>She paid our full money back so that's good. We found another hotel the same night and left immediately.<br/>also : they serve BBQ for 600 000 dong, the meat was not good at all and that is an insane price for food in Vietnam. <br/>I really hope she takes away the monkey's and asks normal prices for the"

Listing pics should be specific to room being advertised.<br/>3-Mattress is quite firm.<br/>4-Taxis are not readily available in roads..taxi booking is required (to/from resort), need the host help to arrange it due to language barrier and it‚Äôs relatively expensive (from main road to resort 200k)."

They helped us with everything, they showed so much interest in us and the meals they made us were incredible. It‚Äôs located in a magical surrounding. You hear crickets, frogs, water sounds and the wind. The view from the bed is amazing and we woke up happy every morning. This is the kind of place you come back for. We‚Äôre travelling Vietnam for 4 weeks and we only stayed here for 3 nights but I wish we booked more days here. Even the animals there are so gentle. They have dogs and cats and they are so calm and friendly and want cuddles all day. <br/>It felt like a big family, they interact with you but they also give you so much space for your own time and moments to enjoy the place and the beautiful nature. <br/>We also did a tea ceremony with the woman who created this place. That was also very special. <br/>If I ever come back to visit Vietnam I would love to come back. It‚Äôs lovely."

It‚Äôs near both the city center and the valley for exploration, we are able to stop by home to rest on our trip midway. The host is very supportive and the place is clean. It‚Äôs in a quieter neighborhood so we are able to enjoy the view and the chill vibe of Dalat. The food list recommended by the host is super helpful, especially when there are so many different restaurants and reviews online. Overall 10/10, this is the second time I‚Äôm here and will come back again for sure"

Not the hosts fault but the people in the room above us were VERY loud and you can hear every footstep they make. Sounded like they were playing beer pong.  We notified host and she said other guests had complained as well.  She said she contacted them to tell them to quieten down which they did eventually after midnight üò° <br/>Room was clean and as described.  Very hard mattress.  Didn‚Äôt realise you had to turn on hot water switch to have a hot shower.  Ok fit a one night stay."

The calm energy and nature around you make it easy to focus, think, and just be. Plus, the Wi-Fi is super fast (100 Mbps), so it‚Äôs great for remote work too.<br/>What truly makes it special is Haien, the most caring and thoughtful host we‚Äôve ever met. From the moment we booked, she made sure everything was perfect. She shared amazing local tips, gave us extra amenities, and even woke up early on our checkout day to give us fresh snacks and a sweet gift. It felt like staying with family.<br/>We left feeling refreshed, inspired, and so grateful. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough‚Äîthank you, Haien, for creating such a beautiful space."

I had so many laughs with him and his staff, and the beautiful, sweet dogs added so much joy. The fire made the nights perfect and cozy. My room was luxurious with a stunning view, and the food was incredible. We even went on a hike together to discover the beautiful landscape. They offered me rides to the airport and Dalat center, and I truly felt like a princess. The coffee was excellent, and I loved discovering his coffee plantation. This place is warm, fun, and unforgettable!"

The bed is fine. <br/>Their garden and the place overall look cozy and lovely, their cats are adorable but the smell from their feces was too much for me especially after it rain. <br/>Breakfast was the highlight of the stay. But the room really not meet up with the price, maybe that‚Äôs why they only have 1 pic of the room? Cause it really underwhelmed for me when I entered the room. <br/>Would recommend this place for breakfast and coffee but for staying there not so much."

The flat has everything you need and is well located for getting out and about around Dalat. The curtains in the bedroom did mean some light fed into the room, however, the host has advised that this is due to be fixed goingforward."

Location is good to go everywhere. <br/>The stairs at the entrance are so steep that it may be difficult to climb with large luggage. But it‚Äôs worth to stay to see beautiful view. <br/>Overall I really enjoyed to stay 3 nights here. Baileys is nice and responsive guy. <br/>Also his staff are friendly too."

The view was also mesmerizing. The sunrise was just beyond beautiful. Thank you Ho for the great hospitality."

Unfortunately, the feeling we got upon arrival didn‚Äôt quite match what was conveyed in the photos. While the view from the apartment was truly spectacular, the space itself felt like it needed more care and ongoing maintenance.<br/>That said, Bailey Ho was extremely professional, responsive, and quick to act once we voiced our concerns. He offered us the option to move to another apartment for the night and even provided a partial refund ‚Äî more than what we had requested. Ultimately, we chose to relocate to a different accommodation, but we truly appreciated how sincerely Bailey took our feedback and how promptly he worked to make things right.<br/>Overall, while the space itself didn‚Äôt meet our expectations, the host‚Äôs handling of the situation was exemplary."

The elevator was quite small and a bit inconvenient, especially when carrying luggage. Additionally, to reach the room, you have to climb some stairs with your bags, which might be difficult for some guests. A refrigerator was also missing, which would have been useful.<br/>The place was generally nice, though it felt a bit dusty ‚Äî as if the floors hadn‚Äôt been cleaned thoroughly. I would also suggest improving the quality of the slippers. They were old and worn out; new disposable slippers would make a big difference.<br/>That said, I would probably stay here again, mainly because the view is just breathtaking. With a few small improvements, this place could be perfect."

The room is comfy and spacious. A remark on the toilet light - I think it‚Äôs a sensor one, so you need to move a bit if it turns off."

The room was clean and comfortable, with lots of natural light from the high ceiling window panels and a minimal aesthetic.<br/>What made it even better was the location! It is tucked away in a peaceful area overlooking the greenhouses that light up at night (so beautiful), but still close enough to cafes, the lake, and the night market with a short Grab ride. Perfect if you want to enjoy Da Lat‚Äôs calm side without being too far from everything.<br/>Tin was kind, very responsive, helpful, and thoughtful. From check-in to small things that were needed during the stay, he was proactive and made sure everything went smoothly. Definitely a stay I‚Äôd come back to!"

You have to remember you are in nature's garden, so expect bugs and insects. The views are phenomenal and they are both very hospitable. We arrived earlier than check in and were allowed to check in early. We were then helped with getting into town. The tea and the coffee are beautiful and made fresh by Tuyen. We had a homemade breakfast, which was a nice mix of bread and salad (which cost 200k for 2 people). The dogs on site are beautiful and friendly. Tuyen showed us his coffee farm, which is beautiful, we went and saw the clouds up there the following morning.<br/>All in all a nice and quiet place to stay, I would highly recommend going and enjoying their hospitality."

Genoten van heerlijk ontbijt van verse producten uit hun eigen tuin. <br/>Echter wel ver van Dalat, met grab >30 minuten. Vanaf het entree van terrein moet je een lang stuk lopen over een stijle weg met je bagage naar de kamer. Gecombineerd met regen is dit pad heel glad.<br/>Maar Tuyen en zijn vrouw zijn zeer vriendelijk en doen hun best om je verblijf aangenaam te maken. Als je rust wil is deze plek een aanrader!"

The bungalows have floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking greenery everywhere and a rushing stream. Each bungalow has two floors with one room each - the upper has two beds and the lower has one bed - both rooms have superb views. The rooms have some bugs because you are right in the middle of a beautiful green jungle. You can also hang out at the open cafe space to get some delicious homemade coffee from their farm. They can also make you some homemade healthy food (it‚Äôs a bit pricey for Da Lat) but there are no restaurants around the area, and plus we enjoyed the interaction. The area overall is so peaceful. They have planted lots of flowers, coffee plants and new plants all around the property which is so nice. The best part is the family (including doggies!). They are so responsive and friendly and so happy to share their experiences with you. We really enjoyed talking to them. Thank you so much!"

It was in a very peaceful location - not too far from the hustle and bustle of Da Lat but still felt nestled away in your own little sanctuary. Ngoc provided us with great recommendations for food and drink around us - we frequented some places more than once! Also had very sweet dogs on the property that loved some pats. Definitely recommend staying here and would 100% return for another stay in Vietnam!"

Just like its name, a small cozy garden, cool breeze, quiet space, hidden gently among pine hills.<br/>The host was kind and gentle, she gave me a warm welcome, softly. She helped me a lot with a little trouble I had, I think she truly deserves an extra star for that.<br/>This was the most beautiful room in the whole place. If you come in the right season, when the persimmons are ripe, you may find the stay even more lovely.<br/>Thank you, truly, for welcoming me like that."

There‚Äôs no AC but as Dalat is slightly cooler and the room is built to stay cool, you don‚Äôt need it. <br/>Ngoc was really helpful and super responsive if we needed anything. <br/>We‚Äôd definitely stay again if ever we‚Äôre back in Dalat! <br/>Thanks :)"

The hostess is the kindest and most welcoming person ‚Äî she made us feel at home from the very first moment. The atmosphere is magical: peaceful, charming, and full of heart. We even got to pick fresh strawberries right on the property ‚Äî they were unbelievably delicious and natural. We truly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. Without a doubt, we will be coming back here again. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a perfect getaway!"

The room was clean, cozy, and mosquito-free, with unique lighting and windows,  feel like living in a warm little cave surrounded by trees. I wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer.<br/>The location is great, next to Bao Dai Palace 3 and close to Crazy House. The host shared a wonderful Google Maps guide of local caf√©s, bar and restaurants, with personal notes for each spot(which is so cute) . Thanks to her, I found some hidden gems, especially the amazing street-side canel√© stall. <br/>Highly recommended for both comfort and care!"

It‚Äôs only a short Grab ride into town. <br/>On the farm, there are two very friendly dogs. Unfortunately, they were barking for the better part of the two nights we stayed there. So we didn‚Äôt get a lot of sleep. <br/>The bed was not made for tall people since it is quite short. Also, there are a lot of mosquitos but Ngoc supplied us with some good mosquito repellent."

The garden is absolutely beautiful, and both the room and shared spaces were thoughtfully decorated. The fireplace kept us warm and was the perfect way to end the day.<br/>Moreover, our host was great! He was very kind, helpful, and attentive to all our needs. He responded quickly to our questions and made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. We truly appreciated his hospitality and care. <br/>Thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful retreat."

Me and my boyfriend agreed it was the most peaceful/quiet sleep we have had in a really long time. All the smallest details were well taken care off. Only small thing is that the water pressure in the shower was really weak but could be because of the LNY cleanind"

Our stay was great,  we liked the location and the place especially the dog that always come to visit us every time we arrived at the place and leaded us back to our room. And, the best place of all was the fireplace, which would keep you warm throughout the night, cozy and warm fireplace, 100 points for that."

The garden surroundings and communal kitchen were an unexpected bonus. Again, were aesthetically gorgeous. it's a little bit out of the main city, we found this location to be peaceful and private. <br/>Indy is such a great host and beautiful person. She was extremely helpful in organising us a bus to our next destination and recommending good food. She also makes a great coffee at her Cafe- bicycle up- Highly recommend here."

The location is truly idyllic, nestled amidst lush greenery and scenic landscapes, perfect for nature lovers and those seeking peace and relaxation.<br/>However, the cleanliness of the homestay left much to be desired. The rooms and common areas could benefit from more thorough cleaning and better maintenance. While the rustic charm of the place is undeniable, the lack of cleanliness detracted from the overall experience.<br/>In summary, this homestay is a great choice for those who prioritize natural surroundings and a serene atmosphere, but be prepared for a stay that might not meet high cleanliness standards."

The host knows what he's doing and made sure that you're looked after when needed. <br/>The area was particularly nice. The area/roads are nice to walk. It has access to nature/the woods, it's well connected to the main road and the views from the room/the bed are endless. <br/>It's also up to western standards, as traditional living is quite different, so what you expect to be there is there. Can't go wrong with booking this accomodation!"

The host was incredibly sweet, considerate, and friendly, making us feel truly welcomed. They even allowed us to store our luggage after check-out, which was a huge help. Plus, they have the cutest puppies! If you're a dog lover, this place is 100% for you. Highly recommended, and we would love to stay again!"

The bungalows are nicely decorated, with a comfortable bed, in a peaceful and quiet garden with adorable dogs and chickens.<br/>Uyen and Tuyen were really nice, always making sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed.<br/>Location was really nice, in a quiet neighborhood but with lots of food options nearby and the city center only a quick Grab ride away.<br/>I'll stay here again when I'm back in Dalat"

Uyen was incredibly responsive for everything - we asked for a mosquito net as it was raining over our stay & she straight away responded & brought over the mosquito net as well as spray (she always went above & beyond). <br/>The best part about this stay though was definitely the dogs. They are some of the sweetest dogs I‚Äôve ever met, we will definitely miss them! <br/>Thank you so much for the great stay, if we are back in the area we will 100% be back.

It‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre comfortable on driving a motor bike, as there are no other ways to get around (besides a taxi). I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you‚Äôre travelling with your family, as the cabin is very small and simple."

Le chalet est tr√®s mignon et le cadre super, malheureusement nous avons eu une coupure de courant a notre arriv√©e donc pas d'electricite pendant un moment. L'accueil √©tait bon et le service aussi. je recommande chaudement le barbecue qui √©tait d√©licieux. Petit b√©mol sur la douche qui n'a pas de d√©bit et sur la vaisselle qui n'√©tait pas tr√®s propre. Aussi le logement est tr√®s ouvert sur l'ext√©rieur donc si vous avez peur des insectes ce n'est pas un lieu pour vous mais c'est pr√©cis√© dans l'annonce du logement. <br/>On a pass√© un moment g√©nial malgr√© quelques petits b√©mols qui sont rectifiables. A noter : les √©changes sur air BNB √©taient fluide et amicaux, c'√©tait tr√®s agr√©able."

This room is better for solo traveller- the windows can climb to the balcony. There are many beautiful plants inside and outside the house. It is better than the picture, and the picture cannot make that feeling, so please believe it. The only thing is that it is a little far from city center, about 4.8km, but it doesn't matter. It will be very convenient if you rent a motorbike. <br/>If you are looking for a quiet place to stay, choose here!"

The whole house is decorated so beautifully ‚Äî you can tell she‚Äôs put a lot of thought into it.<br/>I stayed in the attic, and wow‚Ä¶ the view from the window was amazing. The location is perfect, and when it rains, the whole scene outside just looks magical.<br/>Everything looks exactly like the photos, maybe even better. I had such a good time here, and I‚Äôm 100% coming back. Already told my friends they have to stay here too. Thanks, Mai, for being such a wonderful host!"

          "comments": "The view from the room is unbeatable. I flew to Dalat for some solo slow traveling and this is exactly what I needed. The host is very responsive and helpful! She even provided an umbrella because of the wet weather. The location is a 10min drive from the city centre, but near to robin hill cable car and the Alphine coaster. Because of this you can expect a less hectic and more peaceful surrounding. One thing that can be improved on is ensuring the camping chairs in the BBQ area are clean and of good condition. I wanted to enjoy the view outside the room but there was nowhere comfortable to sit. Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay! For the first time I slept very well uninterrupted. üôÇ"

View from the room was great as we could see many great features such as the clouds below us, windmill on the opposite mountain, sunrise, other surrounding mountains, stars etc. In the homestay, there are many beautiful plants, flowers and fruits like jackfruit, pessimon, strawberry, coffee etc. Could tell that the hosts put a lot of effort and thought into decorating the homestay to be beautiful, comfortable and welcoming to guests. The hosts even took the initiative to bring us around by bike to show us different attractions like strawberry farm, tea plantations, cherry blossom, nice cafe etc. They also helped to arrange transportation during checkout. Overall, hosts were very helpful, friendly and genuine. 100/100 would recommend."

Nous avons √©t√© surclass√©e de chambre √† notre demande pour b√©n√©fici√© d‚Äôune terrasse priv√©e, nous avons tout de suite eu une r√©ponse positive. Nous avons donc repris une nuit de plus! Nous avons sinc√®rement ador√© ce s√©jour, nous nous sommes senti comme √† la maison et d‚Äôailleurs nous avons m√™me √©t√© invit√© √† manger avec eux un midi.

The view from the room was stunning, and the location was super convenient ‚Äî easy to find and close to everything I needed. <br/>There‚Äôs a 24/7 convenience store and coffee just downstairs, which came in handy more than once, the coffee was good ‚Äî a great spot to relax. <br/>What truly made the stay memorable was the amazing staff. They were so kind and supportive throughout my time there, always ready to help whenever I had a question or needed something. Their warm attitude really made me feel at ease.<br/>I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. I‚Äôm already looking forward to coming back next time!"

          "comments": "My stay at Ivy Coffee Farm Airbnb in Vietnam was an absolute delight! This cozy cottage exceeded my expectations with its incredible value for money. Its proximity to the airport was a huge plus, allowing me to soak in the enchanting rainforest atmosphere of the coffee farm without the stress of an early morning rush to catch a flight. It was truly a pleasant surprise.<br/>What makes this place special is that the owner personally built the cottage and meticulously arranged everything inside. The entire space exudes the charm of Vietnamese rural life, which I adored. I‚Äôm sure a week-long stay here would be incredibly comfortable. Given its location in the rainforest, it‚Äôs no surprise that there were small insects, ants, and mosquitoes around, but it‚Äôs a small price to pay for such a unique experience.<br/>Without a doubt, I give this place a solid 5-star rating! When I return to Da Lat, I‚Äôll definitely choose to stay here again and immerse myself in the beauty"

From top notch espresso in the morning to tasty home cooked meals in the evening‚Ä¶ it just perfected your day! The cabin was artfully designed and decorated. The bathroom was just awesome with all the plants growing in harmony, such an uplifting feeling! A friend of the hosts is building a new structure next door and it‚Äôs going to be an artisan bakery, we got to taste some great baguette, brioche and croissant, thanks Chi√™n! <br/>It‚Äôs such a great experience at Ivy Coffee Farm!

Beautiful home in the hills with stunning scenery on all sides. Incredible hiking as long as you can handle some serious elevation change. <br/>And the wifi and cell reception are great for those moments when you do need to leave the bubble."

The family brought little snacks once in a while and if needed also dinner. We went to the supermarket twice, the family can drive you to the town, if needed. 2 evenings we spent with the family with some Bbq and it was so nice ‚ù§Ô∏è They are making an effort to communicate with the translator and it works quite well.

Roffelende stortregens op het dak elke middag (regentijd) en verder totale rust. Het uitzicht is zo mooi als in de foto's. Fantastische gastheer en gastvrouw. Zij kookt heerlijke maaltijden voor je, zo vaak als je wilt. Er is vers fruit en andere lekkere hapjes. De kleindochters wonen daar ook en doen je hart meteen smelten. Was graag langer gebleven."

I arrived when I was under stress and going through a bit of a dip, but when I left, I felt like a new person. I stayed from middle May to middle June. The weather was great- in the Goldielocks zone. <br/>But what made it so special were the people and nature. Fireflies at night, hiking in the mountain, the view over the valley and the beautiful blue skies... it was magical. I got treated almost every day by the hosts. <br/>They brought me fruits and smoothies without me ever asking. I took the scooter out once a week and it was cheap and reliable. I would recommend this place highly and will return next year! <br/>Thanks so much for everything."

The place is great for longer stays, as long as you are good with the scooter/motorbikes. <br/>We built ourselves some standing desks on the Balcony and had a productive time with some amazing Human connections. When you come here you have the chance to enter a community of amazing, heartfelt and and open people that meet up for an Artclub in one of the amazing local caf√©s that are also great for working. <br/>The family that runs the farm is extremely kind and welcoming! They share their home grown fruits, homemade smoothies and all sorts of other Vietnamese dishes with you.<br/>When we got sick they even drove us to a nearby doctor, when we were in the woods when it got dark they called to make sure we are ok, and generally it feels very safe at the farm up on the hill.<br/>Once again thank your for the wonderful stay! <3"

She‚Äôs incredibly welcoming, cheerful, and generous, her food is delicious, and we would have great conversations using Google Translate.<br/>Her husband is just as kind and helpful‚Äîhe even rescued me when I got lost in the nearby mountains! Honestly, the family did everything they could to make sure I have the best possible stay.<br/>The place itself is just as gorgeous as in the pictures. The views are stunning, and the only thing I would hear is the sound of nature‚Äîpure peace and quiet. <br/>The studio had everything I needed: conformable bed, full equipped kitchen, a beautiful terrace, a desk, a bathroom, etc.<br/>I really hope to come back someday. Next time, I‚Äôll make sure to learn how to ride a motorbike beforehand, since that‚Äôs the main way to get around here. That said, the family was always happy to give me a ride.<br/>Thank you so much, Ms. Van and family."

I loved feeling like i was part of the family. So many unexpected things mostly wonderful and it was exactly what i was looking for: a more authentic experience of Vietnam. <br/>I loved being away from everything. I loved the daily food, and delivered to your door or sit and eat looking out over the hillsü§Ø<br/>Internet great for work. But also great just to explore the area. I loved being one of the only foreigners and with Google translate you don‚Äôt need to speak the language. Quinn and family are lovely and it was just perfect for me. If you‚Äôre looking for authenticity go here. If you‚Äôre looking to complain go elsewhere to keep the vibe because it feels like a sacred place. üòÅ"

The Luu family went out of their way to make my stay as pleasant as possible.<br/>Communicating through a translator had its own charm. <br/>It you'd like, you can order homemade meals. There's also the option to do laundry and get help with arranging transportation.<br/>The cabin is located on a hill, so you'll need a bit of strength in your legs, but that's its greatest advantage. No pollution or noise reaches here-just fresh air and the scent of blooming coffee :)<br/>It was the best stay in Vietnam I could have ever imagined!"

Many small comforts are provided to better accommodate you.This place is one of the few places that I found is the same as it is pictured in the host description (in this case it‚Äôs better!). From Vietnamese home cooked meals that are available for breakfast, lunch and dinner, to the authentic livening quarters (equipped with western and Vietnamese bed). I really enjoyed the availability of fresh bananas and avocados on the farm. Everyone went out of their way to accommodate my needs, from cooking vegan meals to clearing the trails so that I could go hiking up in the mountains in the surrounding area. Thanks to the willingness of the family to use a translate app, we shared many laughs and cultural experiences. This is one stay that will forever remain close to my heart. Thank you Quynh & familyüôè"

I didn‚Äôt cook and Qu·ª≥nh‚Äôs mother helped with delicious food everyday. Some of the fruit n veg are fresh from their garden and orchard.<br/>The view of the mountains & pine forests is stunning. You can hike up or down the hill. The hike up is very steep but the view at the top is worth all the ‚Äòcrawling‚Äô. If you hike down, beware that the neighbour‚Äôs dogs can be intimidating when you pass.<br/>If you feel adventurous, I recommend asking the host family for a bike to go on your own bike ride through the villages towards Ta Nung pass. It is one of the most scenic rides in Vietnam, rivaled only by the one in North east Vietnam.<br/>I can‚Äôt recommend this home enough to those wanting to experience mountainous Vietnam at its most peaceful and authentic.<br/>Huge thanks to Qu·ª≥nh & family for sharing your home & treating guests with so much warmth and hospitality ‚ù§Ô∏è"

The town is a quiet, local town. Our tent was right by the waterfall, we had such a good time just watching the waterfall. The roads that took us up the mountain were also beautiful. Zenda served us great local food - we had a bbq as well as a hotpot. Our hosts were lovely and attentive. Definitely recommend this place if you are traveling to Vietnam but want to go off the beaten track."

In addition to the amazing place, the host (Kenzo) was the most welcoming and friendly host I‚Äôve ever met, he went above and beyond on ever measure. Definitely recommended this place to anybody from a party of two to 14 people, great value for money."

It was located in the alley, a central location with a sense of privacy. We were warmly welcomed by the host family and their super friendly doggos, and surrounded by beautiful garden. <br/>One day, we left our helmets on the motorbike and thought they probably got soaked after the rain, but we realized the host had already brought them inside for us so they stayed dry. It‚Äôs the little things like that that made us love this place!"

It gets cold at night in December so be prepared to be close to the heater. Place was clean and cosy, though there isn't that much around in walking distance. Hence the quiet. Get a vehicle and you'll be good! City centre is a 5 minute ride away."

She stayed in touch with us throughout the evening and personally greeted us at the gate upon our late arrival.<br/>The property has five extremely adorable dogs, which made our stay even more special. At first, I was afraid of dogs, but their friendliness quickly put me at ease. Among them, the corgi (who happens to be the dad!) stayed near our door at night, which made me feel incredibly safe.<br/>The wooden bungalow was cozy, and the host was very kind and accommodating. It was such a unique and memorable experience! One tip: Da Lat can be chilly, so pack some warm clothes.<br/>Also, don‚Äôt forget to bring mosquito repellent, as there are mosquitoes nearby that might disturb your sleep. But no worries‚Äîthe host thoughtfully provides some spray as well.<br/>I highly recommend this stay for anyone visiting Da Lat! üåü"

          "comments": "This was a perfect place for us to retreat after a long day in the city and markets. The bungalow is surrounded by nature, there is literally a tree outside the door and we loved it. It‚Äôs exactly what we needed after many weeks with city life. The place is super central and it‚Äôs hard to imagine a place like this existing with so many plants and trees so close to everything. You just have to go there and see it to believe it. <br/>The hosts are warm and welcoming. I don‚Äôt even know how to describe the hosts but they are the type of people that just warms your heart. <br/>They have some dogs, they all were very cute and just wanted cuddles and attention. They will also leave u alone if u tell them to go so they weren‚Äôt a problem at all. Oh and they also have chickens running around. It might sound like a lot but it was the perfect harmonious place to relax in a natural environment.<br/>We extended our stay many times and ended up staying there for the rest of our days in Da Lat"

Although the host tried to fix it, it still affected our experience. The cleanliness and facilities also need improvement. There was dust in many places, the curtains didn‚Äôt block out the light well, and the sound insulation was poor. For the same price, I believe there are many better options in Da Lat.<br/>Things aside, Uyen and Tuyen were very nice, and they responded promptly. The few puppies alone were worth 2 stars‚Äîthey were just so adorable!"

Warm colours, clean and thoughtful furnishings as well as artistic talent of hosts.<br/>Practically designed cosy interior with perfect space for two guests.<br/>First night we weren‚Äôt so lucky as the next property had noisy guests who yakked past midnight at their yard which our cottage overlooks.<br/>Subsequently we did enjoy peace.<br/>Lovely local restaurants and eateries nearby, very walkable and safe.<br/>Tuyen helped to change our sleeper bus booking in time (wrong date booked!) Thankfully! <br/>He was hard at work on refurbishing another unit, all the best!"

The bungalow was spacious and clean with a comfy bed and the area was so much nicer than downtown but still close to everything.  We saw a beautiful sunset from our terrace. there was good communication and the dogs were so lovely even for a non dog person, so don't worry if you are a but weary of dogs they are very calm.

Moreover, when u had not come to Dalat they also help u to recommend some place which suitable for u and ur style. All the furniture is so cute and warm. Even though just a short trip but i felt like home when i were there. Hope more people will come to this place and also me if i had a chance. Thanks so much for your service and talking. Love u all."

Am Abend konnte ich auf dem Dach des Busses mein Bier trinken und ein Buch lesen, und am Morgen auf dem Dach fr√ºhst√ºcken. Wenn man am Morgen aufwacht und die hinter T√ºr √∂ffnet, findet man ein Paradies vor sich!<br/>Die Gegend ist auch frei von Menschen ‚Äì echt ein sch√∂ner Ort f√ºr Naturliebhaber! Apropos Natur: Vergesst bitte nicht, euren M√ºckenspray sowie Sonnencreme mitzunehmen!<br/>Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass in der Regenzeit die Erreichbarkeit eine Herausforderung sein kann, da es keinen Asphalt bis zur Gegend gibt.<br/>Ich habe hier auf dem Weg von Saigon nach Hanoi √ºbernachtet und war mit dem Motorrad unterwegs. Ich w√ºrde es f√ºr Motorradfahrer weiterempfehlen!"

It is harder to get there after rain on scooter, because last few hundred meters is dirt road. But nothing you can do, just drive carefully. As for the mobile home it was older then on the photos, also expect some bugs inside. But hey, you are in the nature, so it os part of it üòÖ only two things that bothered us were that on few places there was mold inside. And the matress was realy hard so not really confy to sleep on, so we did not sleep well. On the other hand, the BBQ we ordered was amazing - very good meat."

How does it feel staying here? It feels like home. <br/>I will miss this place sooo much."

Die gemeinsamen Abende mit dem selbstgekochten Essen (hier nochmal ein Lob an Tuy‚Äòs Frau) und den Gespr√§chen bis Tief in die Nacht, aber auch das frische Obst und der Kaffee von Tuy, sowie die morgendlichen Gespr√§che in der K√ºche mit seinen zuckers√º√üen Kind, das frische Geb√§ck von Tuy‚Äôs Freund, der nebenan ein √§hnliches Haus baut und die beiden sehr freundlichen Hofhunde - All das werden wir vermissen. <br/>Es sind mehr als gen√ºgend Restaurants und Superm√§rkte im Ort, dennoch lohnt sich auch ein Ausfl√ºge nach Da Lat oder auch zu der Tempelanlage in Nam Ban."

We hope everyone gets to experience this paradise.üôèüèº‚ú®"

This is my third time driving a motorbike and it was easy üòÜ.<br/>I loved the area, surrounding, staring at the stars,the sunrise. And the nature sounds because there is no one near you for at least 700meters! It was really peaceful.<br/>Cons: <br/>-The pots in the kitchen was not really cleaned there was some left food stuck in the pot. <br/>-There was no sponge to clean the pots and dishes. <br/>-There was a dead rat underneath the Mobihome and caused a bad smell even inside the Mobi.<br/>-They had only beer to buy for a drink. No soft drinks as they mentioned in the description. <br/>-There was no woods to light up a fire at night. I was super excited for lighting up a fire and didn‚Äôt go as expected.<br/>Overall I would suggest everyone to go here for peaceful day!"

In the evening we could even lie on the bus and enjoy the starry sky.  <br/>Communication with the host was clear and they were always available. We were able to park the motorcycles in front of the accommodation and the host even gave us a blanket to cover them. <br/>In the evening she brought us something to eat as a gift, which we were very happy about! Otherwise, we cooked for ourselves in the campsite kitchen. <br/>Of course, this bus is not a 5-star luxury resort, but that shouldn't be the expectation. If you're looking for a beautiful place in the countryside, this is the place for you! There is even an AC in the bus."

The apartment is above a 24/7 store which sells beers and has a lovely view of the valley! The apartment itself only has views of the other side - the road - but easy to pop downstairs or next door to enjoy. Comfy bed, was ok with only fan at night, would stay again for sure"

It is equipped with almost everything you need. It has even a small stream in front. To get here a bit tricky but Linh helps you so you don't need to worry about it. Well, actually the tricky of getting here makes it special :) Only negative thing I have to mention is the men that started working for the construction of the next house from very early in the morning which we were not expecting at all, so it surprised. They were carrying earth from the riverside to the house on their motorcycles passing through the garden of Linh's house. I let know Linh about it and asked her to inform her future guests for the work schedule of them. But this did not vanish the pleasure that we were having by being there at all."

Huge bright stream, the sound of which made it so good to sleep. There is everything you need to cook (Linh even loaded the refrigerator with simple food: eggs, bread, spices oil, peanut butter), we had a barbecue outside in the evening and it was so fun and delicious! Keep in mind that you will have to get to the house through the forest where is no normal road, after 5 pm it will be dark and there will be no lighting, this can be scary, but my friends and I had fun and took it as an adventure, we really liked it, just be prepared that if you are a beginner, driving a bike will be difficult, but Linh immediately offered to help with this, so do not worry, they will help you get there. There are also 2 cute puppies, I love animals and played with them all the time, after I got bites probably from fleas, so wash your hands üòÇ"

          "comments": "I recently had the chance to stay at this beautiful wooden homestay, and it was truly an experience to remember. From the moment I arrived, I felt an incredible sense of peace‚Äîthe sound of the nearby stream, the fresh air, and the lush greenery all around made it feel like a hidden sanctuary.  <br/>The house itself is simple, but that‚Äôs what makes it special. It‚Äôs clean, cozy, and thoughtfully designed to blend with the nature. I spent my mornings sipping tea on the porch, watching the sunlight filter through the trees, and my evenings enjoying the quiet, away from the city‚Äôs noise.  <br/>What I loved most was the perfect balance‚Äîit‚Äôs secluded enough to feel like an escape, yet close enough to the city.<br/>Highly recommend for anyone needing a reset and a breath of fresh air. I'll definitely be back!"

If you love solitude, nature and want to be away from the noise of the everyday, this is the place. <br/>Few things to remember - you will be on your own as the place in secluded. Do carry groceries if you like cooking else Linh‚Äôs local Manager can provide meals. I had initially booked the place for 4 days but loved it so much that would certainly come back for my rest of the time in Dalat."

We had some issues with check in as the lock was not as described, but she helped<br/>us as quickly as possible. There were no towels when we arrived but she provided them as soon as we asked. There is a bath however the water runs so slowly it would take literally over an hour to fill it. Unfortunately, we were requested to pay a cleaning fee for a mark on the sheets which i didn‚Äôt think was reasonable after a 3 night stay and i contested with airbnb. Another review shows a similar experience, but the apartment is ¬£10 a night and for that we got a very comfy bed, our own private space and walking distance to the town centre so we did enjoy our stay."

It's a great place to relax and it's very close to everything in town. Kitchen is nice with lots of appliances, although I didn't do any cooking this time. Bed is comfortable but on the firm side and pillows are really nice. I will definitely stay here again. Wifi worked great too!"

The incense burned all night long. <br/>The insulation of the window frames need to be professionally sealed/fixed."

Nordic style decor, comfortable bed, state of art / high tech hot shower, amenities, nice neighborhood at walking distance to relevant places. Many Cafes around. Elevator in the building, hotel-like experience with personalized care and attention. Courtesy water bottles available. Safety-oriented building wiith fire plan and fire extinguishers in the hallways, tag-activated elevator that only goes from your floor to the entrance. The owner went above and beyond to assist me on every possible need, helped me booking tickets, let me drop my luggage early in the morning, took my heavy luggage up to the room and even walked me to the van pick up spot. Always very respectful and friendly, good communication skills. I totally recommend this place. And the city is quite cold year-round, so the modern fan  in the room does the trick very well (other parts in Vietnam are very hot and AC is needed, but definitely not the case in Da Lat)."

          "comments": "I booked this place because the lake view looked amazing in the photos. At first, I was a bit hesitant since some old reviews mentioned issues like no electricity, no water. So I checked with the host beforehand ‚Äî they explained it was due to a storm a while back, but everything has been fixed since then. That made me feel much more confident to book.<br/>And honestly, the place is beautiful. A wooden house right by the lake, tucked away in a peaceful natural area. The house has everything you need to cook for yourself, or you can ask the caretaker to prepare meals for a small fee. If you‚Äôre a nature lover and want to escape the city noise, this spot is perfect for you."

Perfect for relaxing and enjoying nature next to a magnificent lake. The place is private and very quiet, we felt at home there. The host is incredible, attentive and kind. He came to see us during the stay, we talked and spent time together. I recommend with your eyes closed. magical moment."

When we arrived, there was no electricity or running water, making the place totally unlivable. The host was unhelpful and barely responsive, offering no real support. The space itself was not so clean, flies everywhere, the concrete was dirty, stains on the window, and dusty everywhere. It looked more like a run-down shed than anything remotely acceptable. The host still refused to cancel our booking or give any compensation even when we called to complain multiple times. In the end we had to leave immediately and called airbnb support for help to get a refund and find a new place to stay. Extremely disappointing."

There was absolute silence, saved for insect noise and birdsong. There was minor things to be improved with hot water (solar powered so it wasn't hot enough) and the mattress could be a bit comfier. But really, we'll come back again just for this view. Wow!"

We arrived in the evening, was cold and we couldnt warm up. <br/>The rest is fine, we would come back again if the problem with flies is solved."

Always helpful with local recommendations and quick to fix a short internet glitch through the caretaker who lives next door. Dung is also very generous, first giving us free local bananas twice and at the end allowing a late check out when our flight was rescheduled to the evening although he had someone else checking in later in the afternoon on the same day. We already miss the place now that we are in a condo in a bigger city. Visit Bao Loc, you won't regret it."

Pity that the little extras were missing to make the stay more comfortable: no milk, coffee, bread, etc in the kitchen to make a cup of tea/ coffee. No coffee mugs. Some bathrooms the shampoo, gel and face wash were empty containers. Tiny shower towels disappointing. No comfy sofa to relax. Overall, an enjoyable overnight stay, but not enough attention to the small details."

My two week stay was absolutely worth every penny spent. <br/>You must stay with Lily and her family if you visit Da Lat!"

Lily showed me around introducing good eating places and proudly shared Vietnamese culture with me. When I got the flu, Lily made a special tea for me. Everything exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed having a temporary Vietnamese family whom I miss already."

The location of this apartment will let you get to many interesting places quickly as it is nearly in the center of the town. There is a small cafe right under your apartment, where a friendly hostess will feed you delicious homemade Pho Bo. There is a laundry next door where you can get your things washed. There are lots of small shops and stalls around where you can buy ready-made food or fresh staff to cook in your own well-equipped kitchen. <br/>Pho is a very caring, helpful and easy-going host, always ready to make your stay pleasant.<br/>We're sure to recommend this apartment!"

I cannot express how it felt like a pocket dimension, where time stopped, and you are allowed to swing below a porch on a hammock and listen to the birds and the rushing stream, where frogs sing day and night, where you can pick fresh tea leaves to brew a cuppa tea in the afternoon, and enjoy the rain hitting the tin roof‚Ä¶"

Similarly on our last day as we had a late bus to catch with letting us stay on a bit so that we wouldn't have too much time to kill hauling our luggage around.<br/>The space was homely and cosy with lush green outdoor areas we could enjoy the summer weather. The kitchen came well equipped which allows for guests to stay in if they so wish. <br/>The bean bags were the cherry on top of the icing and having Nala and Lem as furry companions made this a true home away from home."

I hardly ever closed the door or windows, never worried about locks. 4 dogs and 2 cats pretty much spent the entire time with me, one of the cats sleeps in the bed. Neighbors are family members of the owners, and roast coffee. There‚Äôs a cafe bordering the property which I visited every day, with its own two dogs and two cats, and probably the best vibe of anywhere I spent in Da Lat. Hosts spoke great English and were so nice. It was a perfect stay."

The room and accommodation was spacious and provided all materials need for the stay including cooking equipment, towels, drinking water etc. The wooden charm of the cabin was extra special and the hosts were always available to help. The highlight of my trip was the mom dog Nala and her two puppies, also the 2 cats that visited. Just make sure to bring allergy tablets if you need as they cats sleep on the bed with you. I can highly recommend this stay if you are wanting some peace and quiet in the beautiful surroundings."

The beautiful scenery, comfortable ammenities and lovely nature of both the hosts and the environment made it a super enjoyable stay. We loved spending time in the garden and playing with the animals. We will miss the puppies, the cats & Nala who always stayed by our side. Waking up with the sun on our face as we drank local coffee every morning was the perfect way to start our day. Laying on the beanbags by the fire at night was the perfect way to unwind. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful and comfortable stay while in Dalat. We became quite attached to the place and will definitely visit again."

It can be a little challenging getting down on a bike but is walkable. despite that, its absolutely worth the journey. its peaceful, its private, its perfect. We came to celebrate a birthday and they decorated the place as a surprise and it was so lovely and kind of them. The dog is incredibly friendly! Their brother is also very kind and everyone is so approachable. Ah, loved it so much we ended up staying longer. <br/>Thank you for this space!!"

          "comments": "Stay at the cabin was a therapeutic experience that hits all the right spots for a urban dweller. The quaint, lived-in wooden house offers a taste of rustic living, with adorable companionship of 2 cats and 2 dogs. Furnishing and amenities are simple and yet thoughtfully designed. Located at the bottom of a populated valley of sort, the view isn't noteworthy, but the lush greenery gives good privacy and pleasant tranquility. Location is decent -- 10~20mins stroll to the biggest grocery/shopping complex and several attractions, though need to go through narrow alleyways, and the very steep slope was a mini-exercise to climb or descend. Hosts are friendly, helpful and provided great local recommendations. <br/>Overall it's a lovely place that offers a unique experience. Made my Dalat trip so much more memorable than a hotel stay would. Very thankful."

The wooden cabin is cozy and spacious, offering all the comforts you need for a relaxing getaway. The hot water, TV, and amenities were excellent, and the fully equipped kitchen made it easy to prepare meals. While the bed could be a bit bigger for two people, it was still comfortable, and the bean bags were a delightful touch.<br/>The environment is tranquil, and the insects were surprisingly not bothersome. The sound of the rain on the cabin‚Äôs roof added a soothing ambiance, making it a perfect place to sleep and rejuvenate. As dog lovers, we absolutely adored the friendly dogs on the property, which made our stay even more enjoyable.<br/>Overall, this cabin is a hidden gem, especially for those seeking a healing retreat."

Umgeben von einer traumhaften Pflanzenwelt, taucht man in ein kleines Paradies ein. Fern ab von Verkehr und L√§rm liegt diese liebevoll gestaltete Umgebung in einem Tal und ist nachts umgeben von vielen Lichtern. Ein absolutes Highlight sind dazu dann noch die Hunde und Katzen, mit denen man nach Lust & Laune spielen und kuscheln kann. F√ºr uns war dieses Erlebnis genau das richtige nach mehreren Tagen Stadtleben. In der Unterkunft ist alles vorhanden was man braucht. Die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich, aufgeschlossen, antworten schnell und helfen mit Tipps f√ºr die Umgebung oder Vermittlung f√ºr zB Scooter. Wir sind sehr dankbar f√ºr dieses ‚ÄûHideout‚Äú und werden noch lange davon schw√§rmen. Einziger Hinweis f√ºr Lauffaule: der Weg ins Tal und wieder hinauf ist ggf etwas anstrengend. Aber: es lohnt sich üòã"

Every corner feels like it has a story, from the vintage-style furnishings to the handpicked little details that make the space feel like home.<br/>The garden is amazing, full of flowers and veggies that the host clearly puts a lot of love into. The kitchen has a stunning view overlooking the greenhouses ‚Äî such a treat to wake up and sip coffee there in the morning.<br/>Although it‚Äôs close to the city center, the neighborhood is incredibly quiet, so you get the best of both worlds. The location is easy to find, with convenient car parking on-site . <br/>The host is wonderful, super friendly, responsive, and always ready to help with anything you need."

The room is exactly as described on the site, extremely clean and smell really good. We didn‚Äôt realize we need a window only when there is none, the room can be very bright during the day but we didn‚Äôt really like to leave the door open for fresh air. <br/>During the stay, I unfortunately had an accident with the slipery hair conditioner we brought, extra note here that please wear the pair of slippers the host prepped for you, because the the floor can get a bit slippery during and after you had your shower.<br/>After the accident, the host was really nice to brought me ice to ease my pain, they even went out of their way to retrieve the bike I rent from them when I have to had my hand all bandaged up.<br/>All and all, really nice host, cute cats and dog, nice looking roster of bikes to rent. Love the place, too. Highly recommend, would stay here again."

The curtains also need to be replaced with fabric type rather than the sliding wooden as it‚Äôs hard to close up and down whenever you want to walk out or somewhat enhance your privacy.<br/>The host family is very friendly and warm towards me. It‚Äôs been a blessed to stay here during CNY. <br/>Highly recommend! Thanks for the stay."

Shared dinners with family-far enough out of town to escape, but close enough to blast in for supplies. Received a beautiful belt handmade on property-great gift! About an hour from Da Lat city, but I was happy I stayed here away from the bustle of Da Lat. Thanks again to the entire family. T took me hiking up the mountain behind farm- beautiful views! If you‚Äôd like to find a milder climate in Vietnam, stay here. It is awesome!!!"

My boyfriend and I were looking for an oasis to connect with nature and focus on work while staying in a peaceful, quiet place- and this is exactly what we found. We were welcomed in such a kind manner, and they were so helpful in any and all ways they could be, they even invited us to join during celebrations and a BBQ during a Vietnamese holiday. The garden, fruit trees, fire pit, and waterfall make the outdoors so enjoyable to be in. WiFi was perfect. We really felt at home and we wish their family the best of wishes. 10/10 stay. So grateful!!"

The place is spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, close-to-nature kind of vibe, suitable for those who like quietness and tranquility. It must be warned that the slope leading to the house is very narrow and steep, it‚Äôs not accessible by cars which makes transporting luggage a pain. Other than that, everything else was great. Highly recommend."

The house itself is beautifully designed with a cozy wooden style that feels both rustic and modern. Everything smelled fresh and clean, and the whole place had a calming atmosphere.<br/>The music playing in the common areas added a relaxing touch ‚Äì very tasteful and made the space feel even more welcoming. The host was incredibly kind and accommodating, always ready to help with a smile. It felt more like staying with a friend than a stranger.<br/>The air was so fresh, and the vibe of the place was really friendly and laid-back.

Plus, they put on interesting cultural/artistic events, like movie nights and pottery classes if your interested.  Plus, they even patiently tutor you in Vietnamese if you're learning.  This place attracts the very most interesting guests.  Only problem is it's starting to get a bit famous.  Book it fast!  You won't be sorry!!"

Wake up and make your free toast with eggs and a slice of cake. The owners are super friendly. We rent a scooter there and with a short drive of 5-10 minutes you are in the city center. Do not expect young backpacker vibe but more local tourists and more adult laid back travel vibe. We spent 3 nights here and would recommended it if your looking for a little sweet hangout in Dalat. Enjoy! Tam Biet"

The bungalows are located at the foot of a hill, surrounded by greenery, and the property is eco-friendly, saying no to plastic.<br/>The motorbike rental prices are reasonable. There‚Äôs a self-service area selling soju, soft drinks, and filtered water. For drinking water, there‚Äôs a water purifier available, promoting environmental protection. There‚Äôs also a caf√© counter offering drinks and pastries at fair prices. Laundry service is available but a bit pricey at 30,000 VND per kilogram.<br/>Hot water is provided, but the temperature fluctuates‚Äîsometimes too hot, other times too cold‚Äîthough still usable. Since the homestay is in a garden setting, there are quite a few mosquitoes and insects. There‚Äôs a shared common area that closes and turns off the lights at 11 PM. Overall, the place is clean, small, and charming."

Just a short 5-minute walk from the town center, yet incredibly serene and tranquil. The staff treats you like family and will go above and beyond to make you feel special. A truly rejuvenating stay with exceptionally friendly staff. They even offer scooter rentals, which is a huge plus. Complimentary breakfast and a small grocery collection / mini store on-site. You'll find everything you need here. Don't hesitate for a moment, this is the best stay you can have in Dalat.<br/>Many thanks to the wonderful ladies... Apologies for forgetting their names. All three of them were simply exceptional. Truly an incredible experience!"

You‚Äôre free to explore the garden, pick fresh herbs, and enjoy free coffee, tea, noodles‚Äîeven a glass of wine. Watching the train pass by through the window was such a lovely touch. A bit far from the city center, but perfect for a quiet, soul-soothing stay."

There are a few things I wish I had known before booking: there is a construction project going on right next door, so there was noise throughout my entire stay. Also, the power went out several times when it rained so I was not able to cook on the electric stove. Despite these difficulties, I had a great time here. I would stay again and recommend it to others!"

The place is so well set up for guests - so thoughtfully designed with multiple water and power outlets, plus very good wifi (40MB up & down).  The outdoor deck is a perfect spot to be, reflect, read, write and take in the verdant views of farms, fields, terraces and the southern highlands.   I knew I'd be getting city time in HCMC and wanted to complement that with a slice of Vietnam's agricultural and pastoral side, and my stay there absolutely achieved that.  Highly recommend for anyone used to glamping and who is fine with simple, rustic amenities."

At Ivy Farm, the view was stupendous.  The sileence was majestic.  But what was surprissing was the quality of new friendships that I made there.   Ivy's place attracts a different kind of traveller.  More aware and open.  And Ivy herself is magnificent.  She has dedicated herself to creating a spaace that will provid everything you need.  For a unique travel experience that's relaxing and stimulating at the same time, do yourself a favor.  Stay at Ivy Farm"

She even went shopping for us when we realized we didn't bring enough food and we're farther out then we thought to walk to the nearest market or get grab. Would highly recommend!"

If you are looking for peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is perfect. <br/>What I would like to highlight, however, is the hostess, Ivy. She is an incredibly warm, friendly, helpful person (she even washed my clothes and didn't even charge me for it!). You will never find a better host, I would say, and I have traveled a lot around the world. <br/>If this is what you are looking for, and you are comfortable being far away from luxury and traffic and poor air quality, and are comfortable with a basic lifestyle with incredibly friendly people around you who only want you well, I cannot recommend Ivy's Farm enough. <br/>Try it and judge for yourself. Highly recommended, honestly, fellow travelers. Don't miss this. Thank you so much for a rewarding and memorable stay."

The only negative thing i would say is that the mattress is really hard but we fixed it with asking for more blankets. <br/>I really recommend to stay here!"

We were always met with a big smile. <br/>Highly recommend if you want an escape from the hustle of the big cities!"

We did not feel comfortable renting motorbikes, so with the location of the Airbnb being fairly remote, Ivy and her neighbour drove us around on their motorbikes to see the local sights and pick up groceries. We got to visit a silk farm, a Pagoda, a mushroom farm, and the city of Da Lat. Ivy is an incredibly kind host who will take you where you want to go out of the goodness of her heart, and even brought her karaoke machine and watercolour painting supplies up to the accommodation for our final night!!<br/>The view from the accommodation is breathtaking, and so peaceful. We happily spent our evenings with a beer in hand, sat by the firepit grilling food on the BBQ.<br/>If you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and switch off surrounded by nature, look no further!"

I had issues with my motorbike and language barriers. Ivy was aware of this and messaged me early on my first morning to check if I was okay. She came over, grabbed a pair of scissors, and cut some tea leaves, guava, and stevia, all within twenty feet of where I slept. She tossed those seemingly random leaves into a kettle, and the magic of Vietnam and Ivy's Farm began to unfold. We enjoyed this delicious pot of tea, using Google Translate for over two hours on my first morning as a broken man on a retreat. I started to appreciate the beauty of the hills, the serenity of the land, and the warmth of my hostess. She offered her time to assist me with my motorbike and took me to a nearby village, where we ate incredible food, met local artists, and saw stunning scenery. Most beautiful of all was Ivy's compassion. Best!!"

We even ate food from their farm, all organic.<br/>I really felt like I was treated as part of the family during my stay, which made the whole experience even more heartwarming.<br/>The house itself is very nice and clean. You have your own private space, but it‚Äôs also easy to reach out to the host if you need help. I highly recommend staying here if you want a unique and unforgettable experience!"

I would generally recommend this place.<br/>It is important to know that one of the bedrooms is on a separate, lower floor, with a small window, and you have to go down steep stairs to reach it. With our small children it was a little scary, but we managed. <br/>Overall a modest apartment at a good price in a good location, and I recommend it."

I was sick during our stay there and Moon even cooked for me‚Ä¶ their small attentions all along our stay, along with their warmth made the time we spent there memorable. <br/>And that‚Äôs without talking about the view and the environnement, so cute and nurturing and peaceful. I feel like we gained a 2nd home, a bubble of happiness and coziness."

The pine forest around the property is beautiful, and our room was clean, tidy, and very comfortable.<br/>The host and hostess have clearly put so much heart into their home ‚Äî their garden is beautifully cared for and full of charm. Breakfast was delicious, and you really should try it when you visit!<br/>We also adored their sweet dog and cat. üê∂üê± On our last day, it was raining and the road was under temporary repair. We had two big and heavy suitcases and needed to get a taxi to the airport, but cars couldn‚Äôt reach the property then. The host personally helped transport our luggage by motorbike to a spot where we could catch a taxi ‚Äî thanks to that, we made it to our flight on time. Such kindness truly made our trip even more memorable!<br/>Highly recommended ‚Äî we‚Äôd love to come back again someday. üíõ"

The breakfast is always fresh, the coffee selection is top-notch, and the views of the moonrise are simply magical. <br/>But what truly makes Moonrise special is the warm, welcoming staff‚Äîthey go out of their way to make you feel like family. The couple who owns Moonrise are absolutely the sweetest and kindest people you'll ever meet. Their warmth and genuine care for every guest really make this place feel extra special.<br/>If you're looking for a place to relax, unwind, and enjoy some quiet moments, I highly recommend this cozy haven. It‚Äôs a little slice of peace that‚Äôs hard to beat."

It is absolutely the best option for enjoying the nature with the company of cute dogs and cats, as long as a very warm and kind couple! It is also convenient to grab a taxi or ride a motorbike to the center, so any guests would not need to worry about the convenience^^ You will also be able to enjoy amazing breakfasts every day with a breathtaking view of forests and flowers. <br/>Mun and her husband are so welcoming, considerate, and passionate. They are always very kind to offer all kinds of help and I have fallen in love with Dalat because of their beautiful souls and their lovely house. If you are an animal lover like me, you‚Äôll enjoy making some new animal friends too!<br/>I would definitely choose Moonrise Garden again if I ever come back to Dalat, highly recommendü•∞ü©µ!"

We had two amazing days and nights at a cozy room with a soothing view to mountains and pine woods. <br/>Listening to the rustle of pine trees in the breeze, chirps of birds and the rattle of cicada, we totally immersed ourselves in the tranquility and tenderness of the great outdoors. We saw the morning fog and squirrels hopping around from our balcony. If you are looking for a quiet and peaceful stay, Moonrise is definitely your choice. <br/>The host is really helpful. He helped us with motorcycle rental, which allowed us to commute to the points of interest in 15 minutes. <br/>The breakfast was great, especially eating in the garden was the BEST. Thank you Moonrise for making our stay in Dalat something we would die for! Wish you all the best!"

The house and the Caf√© are so beautiful. You can sit underneath pine trees, banana palm trees and flowers and plants are all around you. To enjoy drinks or food in the garden was just as amazing as the view! Everyone is very sweet. For my husband it was a bonus that he could use some instruments (Electric guitar, acoustic guitar and E-Piano) and we were happy about the cute dogs and cats too, some of them are very cuddly. With a rented scooter (definetely recommended to explore the whole area!) that the host provided on our request very quickly, we could get easily around the city but there are also caf√©s and restaurants in walking distance. With the grab app its also relativly easy to get around, just more expensive. We would love to come back and enjoy the heartwarming atmosphere again."

The place has very cute cats and dogs that are friendly and keep you company whether you are going by yourself or with a group. I came by myself and felt right at home with the homestay. You get free breakfast and a drink included with the price for the morning hours (7-10am), and the rest of the day you can order yummy drinks and foods if you don‚Äôt feel like going out to town. The location is close enough to the center, but far enough to be away from all the noises. I definitely would come back here again the next time I am in Da Lat."

He paid extra attention and ensured that breakfast for my wife and I was beautiful & delicious. The images of the place are as it is a very homely vibe, quite, peaceful energy and simple (bare essential).  <br/>The dogs Nhuy, Ploy and \"What the Hell\". Yes! \"What the Hell\" definitely add to the character of the place. <br/>If your looking for a stay with personality and not a run in the mill (accommodation). This would give you a taste of local life in Dalat."

Shout out to Uom‚Äôs butler/gardener for that.<br/>The homestay still maintains its stellar surroundings very well. I had 2 nights in a beautiful house within a beautiful garden. Didn‚Äôt even bother going out since there are so many vegetables growing inside, and miss Thao (the butler) helped me buy rice as well as protein.<br/>Most of my time there, I spent recharging, breathing the fresh air and brewing tea or coffee depending on my mood, and every second worth it.<br/> So yes, just like a few months ago, I still recommend you to book Uom. Because you‚Äôre worthy of a nice retreat too!!!"

I didn't expect this private experience can be found right in the city.<br/>A quick ride to Dalat Market only takes 10 mins, and there were some excellent restaurants nearby as well.<br/>I spent this morning walking to a teahouse nearby and it was amazing too.<br/>The cliff could be a bit difficult to climb if you're not a strong driver, but a part from that, i wholeheartedly love my experience here. Too bad that I only spent 1 night as trial here cause I totally would love to stay more.<br/>10/10, will come back very soon to visit Gau and Bo!"

It's a very Da Lat vibe house, the original Da Lat that we haven't seen for a long time, so different from the hustle Da Lat center, and you just only need to drive 10min to Da Lat market. We love the glass walls, the curtains. We could even use fresh veggie in the garden, they have some interesting fruits. Their pets are friendly and lovely, they make us feel like home. They have everything you need for a retreat stay. It takes only few minutes to find a market to buy some foods, so you could enjoy the house from morning till night. Oanh shown us how to go to the pine hill near by, we had a nice walk under the pine trees. Overall, we love our stay and the vibe of the house, we're so glad that we've found this unique experience. Highly recommend this house to who want to find some peace. Definitely will come back to watch the grown up hydrangea, also visit Gau and Bo."

She welcomed me in, let me check in 3hrs before check in time, showed me how to get around, checked in with me every time I came back from outside. Made me feel like home all 3 nights I stayed!<br/>Also, they have 3 cats and 1 dog, so cute!<br/>100% recommended and I will definitely come back."

Our bus arrived at 5 AM (way earlier than expected), and it was ü•∂freezing in Dalat‚Äîbut our incredibly kind host graciously allowed us to check in early. That warmth (both literally and figuratively!) set the tone for our entire stay.  <br/>The real stars of the house were the three cats and one dog‚Äîthe best \"room service\" everüêà ! A special shoutout to Emi and Tux for keeping us company (and stealing our hearts). We‚Äôre so sad we missed saying goodbye due to the heavy rain today, but we promise to bring treats for them next time!"

          "comments": "The apartment is very close to the city center, with a wide selection of food and drinks. Do be prepared to carry your luggages up to the second level of the building, and the walkway to the stairwell is pretty narrow. The apartment is well-kept with a rustic feel, with the wooden decor and all. It was such a pleasure to be staying here, although we were unlucky to get noisy neighbours who were staying upstairs. Not much of sound-proofing, so we just had to deal with it. The street noise is bearable, which is very common in Vietnam anyway. I do like that Phuc Long coffeehouse is just a few steps away from the apartment, so I can get my morning coffee very conveniently. Overall a pleasant experience staying here. Thanks Vu, for hosting us."

Lovely soft bedlinen and good supply of new towels.<br/>Great location with plenty of places to eat close by. Night markets close as well.<br/>Vu was prompt in all communication & very patient with our questions a few times. Vu booked us a driver for a day of sightseeing who was fabulous! Absolutely recommend Vus place for a great few days in Dalat.  10/10! Thanks Vu & Co."

The location is simply unbeatable‚Äîvery central and within walking distance to the Da Lat Market, making it easy to explore everything the area has to offer. There are plenty of food options nearby, so you'll never go hungry!<br/>The host was incredibly kind and accommodating. I was allowed to check in early, which was a thoughtful gesture, and they even offered to store my luggage after checkout, making my departure stress-free.<br/>The space itself is beautifully decorated and feels very cozy, truly making it a ‚Äúhome away from home.‚Äù I loved every moment spent there and would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Da Lat. I can‚Äôt wait to return !"

We loved how cosy and homely it feels, while still being in the heart of the action in Dalat. It's walkable to the markets and lake, with loads of cafes and restaurants on your doorstep (and a great vintage shop about 50 metres away too!) Everything was super clean, with everything we could need, and the bed was the comfiest we have had - it felt like a real luxury to stay here. Vu was also super helpful and friendly, even letting us store our bags before check-in and after check-out. 10/10 - highly recommended."

To be honest, there are some negatives that should be noted, especially for families carrying large suitcases. You have to go down long stairs, which might cause you some harm. I also think there are some things that, in my opinion, are beyond the owner's control. Due to the storm and continuous rain, there are some insects and an electricity problem, but the owner nevertheless made the repairs despite the late hour. There is some disturbance in the morning due to the repairs next to the apartment, which might cause some people to not be able to sleep."

This is a huge plus.<br/>The only con is there is a strange smell in the master bedroom bathroom, and some construction nearby. This is why I have given only 4 stars regarding the nightly rate. It is so peaceful, yet the construction does not match the environment.<br/>The bathroom smell needs to be built with and more lighting added to the unit itself with upgrades to kitchen area for longer stays.<br/>However,  I think the owner will be very responsive to this review, and with that said I can highly recommend this place once these issues have been resolved.

The interior looks just like the photos and includes all the amenities you‚Äôd need for a comfortable, homey stay. It was great to be able to do laundry. The views from the balcony are especially peaceful in the mornings.<br/>Duc and his siblings were very helpful and communicative throughout my stay. This is a great option for groups or anyone looking for a cozy, home-like experience in Dalat.<br/>A few things to note:<br/>‚Ä¢ It is next to restaurant that is doing some construction<br/>‚Ä¢The building is shared with another Airbnb unit and a side area.<br/>‚Ä¢ There are quite a few stairs to reach the unit, so be prepared for some climbing.<br/>‚Ä¢The main bedroom bed is soft and comfortable, while the upstairs bed is a bit firm."

While this may be beyond the host‚Äôs control, it didn‚Äôt spontaneously happen either. I think it would‚Äôve been fair to give guests a heads up that this is ongoing, as the main draw of this place was for the quiet.<br/>Aside from that, cleanliness and overall upkeep could be far improved. The master bathroom had a broken tap which they knew about but hadn‚Äôt fixed until I brought it up, and there was a strong sewage smell wafting from this bathroom during the last 2 days. Can‚Äôt open the windows to air the place especially at night because bugs, and the house gets surprisingly stuffy compared to a concrete house in the city. It‚Äôs also more felt because humidity is higher here compared to the city - a dehumidifier would‚Äôve helped. <br/>Having said that, the host + family were quick to respond & fix issues, but much of these could‚Äôve been avoided."

It‚Äôs a nice bit of morning exercise and totally worth it for the secluded feel and the beautiful ravine view from the porch, where we enjoyed our breakfasts.<br/>The mattresses could be a bit softer compared to what you'd typically find in hotels, but aside from that, everything was more than great. The host responded quickly, the internet was fast and stable, the place was peaceful, the shower was hot and had strong pressure, and the house had everything we needed.<br/>Many thanks to Duc!"

My room was charming and spotless, just as pictured, and the views were breathtaking.<br/>The convenience factor was a major plus. I enjoyed delicious croissants for breakfast, easily ran errands, and then returned for a fantastic dinner at the Italian restaurant downstairs. The goat cheese pumpkin flowers and duck leg confit were absolute highlights.<br/>A special thanks to Kim, the owner. Our conversation was truly inspiring, and his passion for this place is evident. Highly recommend √âmai Valley to anyone seeking a memorable stay in Dalat!"

In my second morning here, I woke up to a blanker of clouds right outside the window. In the other day, I woke up to dreamy thoughts and the urge to jot them down. <br/>Everything is within reach of a motorbike ride. I could easily get food and the minimal things I need to try to live like a local. It's a nice change following my days in solitary at Doi Soi, a hill-side cottage by the same host. Civilization came back to me in the most gentle way. So, do bring something to note down your brilliant thoughts because they will come ;) <br/>It'd been a soothing town stay for me. Like a Ghibli sound track during the day and The Beatles by the night. Like a cup of tea in the sun and a glass of single malt Scotch under the stars. Thank you for the warm cuddle, Da Sar!"

They arranged a taxi to pick us up where the bus left us, helped us rent a motorbike for a really good price, gave us some bikes to go around, shared local recommendations, booked some activities for us and were always ready to help whenever we needed them. Xavy (I hope I‚Äôm writing his name well) even took us for a boat ride to see monkeys and animals around the river. <br/>The place is exactly as described. It‚Äôs not a luxurious place, more like a little cabin which, if you like nature and can get to enjoy the experience of a simple life, you will love. As other comments mention, you get to live a real simple Vietnamese life experience. But, in case you want something different, they also have some rooms right next to this place which are theirs as well. <br/>One thing is for sure, the hosts are lovely people and deserve to be super host just for the amazing treatment they had with us."

It's a great place if you want to learn how Vietnamese people live day by day and learn to know their respectful culture and values. Also they invited to eat with them in traditional way which was amazing. The homestay is close to the national park Cat Thien which is very nice for a day trip. Also Ha Bing can take you on a boat tour on the river to go see the Gibbon monkeys, lots of special birds and the amazing sunset. Thank you so much Ha Bing and family! You are amazing hosts"

Durch die Gastfreundschaft aller Familienmitglieder haben wir uns sehr wohlt gef√ºhlt und wurden immer gut mit Wasser und Essen versorgt. Besonders sch√∂n waren die gemeinsameen Mahlzeiten im Garten der Familie, bei denen wir sehr authentische und vor allem leckere vietnamesische Gerichte genie√üen konnten.<br/>Mit den Fahrr√§dern, die uns zur Verf√ºgung gestellt wurden, konnten wir gut die Gegend erkunden und einfach zum Nationalpark gelangen. Bei allen Fragen und Anliegen (Tourguides/ Weiterfahrt) wurde uns geholfen und wir hatten immer einen Ansprechpartner. Insgesamt hatten wir eine sehr gute Zeit, die Unterkunft ist allerdings nichts f√ºr Personen die \"Luxus\" erwarten. Das Badezimmer ist eher rudiment√§r gehalten, allerdings funktionsf√§hig und es gibt keine Klimaanlage. Das ist vielleicht nicht jedermanns oder jederfraus Sache, die Freundlicheit und Gastfreundschaft gleichen das ganze (meiner Meinung nach) wieder aus."

We got helped with luggage arrangements (when we had to go out before check-in/after check-out time) and supported guiding a shuttle bus down the slope to pick us up.<br/>We appreciated the city-wide water cut notice a day earlier, which really helped us planned our next day accordingly.<br/>Our room, on the ground floor, was spacious and full of amenities. We left the windows open for fresh airs and it was fairly quiet too. The view outside was only  the terrace and some flowers but no prob for us.<br/>Love our stay."

The location was fantastic, you really are able to feel like you're in a treehouse, in the woods of Da Lat. People say it fits Da Lat's aesthetic, and I hate to admit it, but it does. The place was clean, and comfortable, spacious enough for my partner and I. The sliding doors to the balcony transports you into another world. Peaceful and calm, it made our Da Lat stay that much more memorable, knowing we get to come back and crash there at night.<br/>There was issues with the wifi, I know very pretentious of me, but Luan was able to rectify it the next night. Came in handy for use of the provided projector for movie nights. Issue outside of their control is definitely just the dogs in the area. They can get a bit scrappy at night. I would suggest some ear plugs. <br/>100% would recommend to anyone thinking about booking. Do it before it's too late!"

The little wooden house is filled with sensible touch of art and care from little things like flower vase, interior design impressed by Van Gogh inspirations to mosquitos spray and plenty of heaters for cold nights. He even helped us to rent a motorbike for a day with reasonable price. The house is humbly beautiful, located far inside a beautiful garden, peaceful looking out to the pine trees from the balcony.<br/>Though there are plenty of steps and steep walkways due to natural topography, Luan was very proactive to offer us great help carrying our luggages when checkin and checkout. Communication with Luan is very smoothly, efficient and friendly.  <br/>Luan also runs a coffee shop at the front of the property which featured beautiful relaxing garden and nice coffee. <br/>I highly recommend Luan‚Äôs place for a stay in style when in Da Lat."

          "comments": "We had a great stay here, super cute and matches the aesthetic of ƒê√† L·∫°t. <br/>We came in December so it was a bit cold at night but the heater was sufficient and the extra bed meant we could steal the thick blanket from it! They put up a Christmas tree and little stocking which was a cute touch also.<br/>Having a coffee in the morning on the balcony was super lovely and the coffee truck up the hill at the entrance is great if you have activities planned and need a quick coffee before you head off.<br/>The place is private but in saying that it is at the bottom of a hill so personally would not recommend if you have lots of heavy suitcase luggage. The worker did bring ours down for us which was very much appreciated but we did have to bring it back up and we wished we were backpackers in that moment üòÖ"

Warm lighting was spotless, with space divided well between different areas. It also has a lovely tea set that we enjoyed first in the morning on the balcony of the place. Luan was very helpful and responsive with any request that we had. Overall I highly recommend this place"

          "comments": "I stayed at this mobi home with 3 other female friends. One night, someone tried to turn off the lights and open our door around 1‚Äì3 AM, about 3 times. Thankfully, we locked the door so nothing happened.<br/>We were scared and called the caretaker, Ng·ªçc. She was amazing, came right away, stayed overnight, and made us feel safe. Since then, we didn‚Äôt see the suspicious person again.<br/>I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a real break-in attempt, so I didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal. I just inform the host about it and suggested adding cameras for safety. Sadly, he dismissed it, saying he lived there for a month and had dogs to guard the place. But as guests-strangers too, we didn‚Äôt heard any barking directed at us. Also, what feels safe for him as a man isn‚Äôt the same for us as female guests.<br/>I wasn‚Äôt complaining‚Äîjust giving honest feedback. Safety should always come first.<br/>The place is fine and Ng·ªçc is wonderful, but I hope the host takes guest safety more seriously."

The home easily fit my family of ten with a few guests coming over for meals. <br/>There are only two rooms with air conditioning which is not obvious from the listing. This wouldn't be an issue since B·∫£o L·ªôc is typically cooler in the evenings, but the three rooms without AC didn't have an effective way to bring in fresh air.<br/>Other than the cooling, we loved the home.

The property was absolutely perfect: new, clean, and comfortable, with a stunning garden and incredible views of the mountains and lake. Everything went so smoothly, and we enjoyed barbecuing throughout the entire weekend.<br/>I want to give a special shoutout to the host, Khoi. From the very first moment I contacted him to ask about celebrating my birthday at his property, he was incredibly helpful, attentive, and responsive to all my (many!) inquiries. Khoi was always polite, enthusiastic, and clear in his communication. He made sure everything was perfect and that we lacked nothing during our stay. On top of that, Khoi went above and beyond by recommending great places to eat and visit. And as a special surprise, he even gifted me local coffee and a visit to an amazing strawberry farm for my birthday! Who does that? <br/>Truly one of the best hosts I‚Äôve ever encountered."

The house is incredibly spacious, easily fitting our group of 10 adults with children. It's super clean, well-decorated, and fully furnished. The garden is delightful, and it's just a short walk to Nam Phuong Lake, where you can fish and kayak. My kids had a blast! We will definitely return and stay longer on our next trip to Vietnam"

We really loved the stay because it was very cozy and comfortable. The homestay is in the city, shops are walking distance and if you walk, can discover more. Got mini shops nearby or just down at the house to buy snacks. Overall it‚Äôs was a 10/10 stay. Highly recommended!!! üòä"
