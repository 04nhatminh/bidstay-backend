Very quiet also, and having a washer and dryer was really nice.  Both pools are amazing, and plenty of sun beds, chairs and bean bags at the pools and beach.  staff is really friendly.  The host is super responsive and helped us with every request.  We would gladly come back."

The only two complaints I had was that the Projector does not actually work for Netflix as the projector was not updated to a new enough version to run Netflix.

It is spacious, very clean, the balcony was great, the dutch door is a nice addition, and the bed was comfy. I had the best sleep during my trip at Lanni’s place. <br/>(2) Location. The place was strategically located in the center of Hoi An, just 5-10 mins of walk away from the Old Quarter. The street is considerably quiet. Also, it is exactly above An Hy’s vegetarian restaurant. As a Muslim, this is a life saver :). <br/>(3) Service. Lanni’s was very accommodating, able to provide essentials such as laundry, car rental service, and bike rental. You can even pay for all of those services through Airbnb, so everything is a breeze!<br/>Will recommend Lanni’s place to anyone! (:"

The location is perfect, with tons of amazing restaurants, street food stalls, and little hidden gems all within walking distance. I basically ate my way through the neighborhood.<br/>The house itself was super clean and comfortable—exactly what you want after a long day of exploring (or, in my case, eating). The host was incredibly helpful, always responsive and full of great local tips.<br/>If you’re visiting Da Nang and want a clean, convenient spot with a great vibe and easy access to incredible food, this place is a solid choice. I’d happily stay here again!"

The room and linens were spotless, the bathroom was beautiful, fancy appliances (kettle, microwave, toaster all in a beautiful retro style). And most importantly, the bicycles were almost new! Compared to the bikes at our 2 other places, these were really good condition and made our adventuring around Da Nang so easy and convenient. There are a lot of good restaurants just up the street. Location is good for nearby places like Con Market, but you will probably need to Grab to the beach. Distance from Son Tra Night market was walkable - we crossed the Dragon Bridge and it was an easy walk back. 100% would recommend for this price."

Linh was also very friendly and quick to respond to our requests. The only reason that I gave 4 stars was because the construction noise during our stay from 2-6pm that caused us to not be able to rest. Linh had construction at her place, and knowing our luck, her closeby neighbour also had construction. We would appreciate knowing this in advance whatsoever so we could be able to plan better."

It is 5 minutes walk from the Dragon Bridge and the Cham Museum, with many cafes dotting the neighborhood, making it easy to grab a coffee at almost anytime of the day.<br/>Finding it is easy. With clear step-by-step instructions, checking in is breezy. The place is clean I feel at home from the moment I stepped in. The room and bathroom are spotlessly clean with big bed and high quality mattress and pillows. As the place is not facing a main road, I had uninterrupted sleep throughout my stay.<br/>Linh is very friendly and responsive. I will definitely choose to stay here again during my future visits to Da Nang."

In fact, from this Airbnb, you could take a walk or run across the dragon bridge and around to the Cau Song Han bridge and back and it's about 5km total. Super nice!<br/>So many lovely cafes and restaurants around. My favorite cafe for Vietnamese feeling was Tiệm cà phê Cậu Út, right across the street. For working, I loved Ge or Wonderlust cafe.<br/>To the beach is only about 10 mins away by Grab bike.<br/>Linh was super responsive and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy stay in Da Nang."

Very close to the dragon bridge, and tons of storefronts and cafes! We are on a long trip around Southeast Asia, so finding a place with a large kitchen and washer/dryer combo was the highlight for us, definitely made us feel at home with all of those conveniences! The rooms are a decent size, with a private bathroom, desk, mini fridge big bed and wardrobe closet in them (and the air con works very well too!). We thought that the rooms were also pretty well spread out too, as we hardly ever heard the other guests when in them. The common space that you share with the other guests is VERY well maintained and has a homey feel to it, there is an outdoor patio on the ground floor along with a rooftop one! The instructions to get into the house are very clear, which was nice since we arrived quite late into the night. Would ABSOLUTELY recommend this spot and plan to return!"

When you walk into the lobby there’s a beautiful wooden table with benches where we ate breakfast every morning. It was very clean and they had filtered water there that we could drink. They also helped us carry our suitcases up and down the stairs. It’s in a great location and has bikes you can take to the rice fields, beach or the market. You can also order a grab for about $1 usd."

Our room looked exactly like the photos!<br/>It is also convenient to book Grab to get to places like the beach and old quarter! Although it’s possible to walk to these locations, we opted for grab as the weather was quite warm.<br/>I would like to thank Thuy for helping us to arrange for transport to the airport fairly last-minute! We were in need of a taxi and had to leave in 15min, but Thuy was very accommodating and arranged it for us almost instantaneously, which was amazing!<br/>I would stay at this Airbnb if I visit hoi an again!"

It's basically brand new and is a loft style layout with floor to ceiling windows offering an excellent view of the airport, allowing you to watch the planes take off. The sound insulation is good and unlike many of the buildings closer to the beach, there are no issues with humidity/dampness.<br/>The apartment is on the top floor of a mixed-use building on a main street that makes it easy to go all the restaurants and cafes in Hai Chau. It's also really not that far from the beach side of the river either. If you want to enjoy Da Nang but not have to deal with the craziness and traffic of My An in the high season, this is a really good spot.<br/>The hosts are friendly and very responsive."

Pictures posted in Airbnb was exactly the same !! Property is easily accessible and it's just 5 mins from the airport.. Hang was an amazing person .. Her support throughout our stay made our trip an memorable one .. Will definitely recommend to my friends and cousins .. Hoping to come back again to stay in this property ..

As first time visitors, the owner Nhu made check in very easy and was also super helpful in recommending places and things to do. The house comes with everything you need, such as bikes, a mini bar, and even a cute little rock pool that has lighting and massage settings. The location is very good, so you can walk or bike to most things and aren’t far from the busy spots. We spent lots of time in the rock pool, which is so relaxing and such a treat to have. We loved our time here to wind down and explore the area"

The location couldn’t have been better—everything I wanted to see was within walking distance, and they even had bicycles available, which made exploring super convenient and fun.

Highly recommend for anyone looking to recharge in a beautiful, peaceful setting."

L’hôte est très amicale et réactive, elle propose de nombreuses choses aux alentours. <br/>Comme la plupart des autres commentaires, il ne faut pas avoir le sommeil léger avec l’école à côté qui démarre à 6h30. Il y avait aussi une maison en travaux juste à côté ce qui ne nous a pas permis de dormir paisiblement."

All the staff were friendly and approachable. Thank you for a pleasant, peaceful stay in this beautiful place."

You are a bit out of town but it’s nice and quiet because of this. I loved this air bnb and I will definitely stay here again when I return to Hoi an! Thanks for having me :)"

Tony was so accommodating and helped us with anything we needed and met us as soon as we got off to boat at the port so it was a very stress free experience :) Mama Hai fed us very well and was a good laugh. not to forget the fishing trip and snorkelling Long and friends took us on - very local and cute experience.

Tony, the adult son, is proficient in English, and will be your best contact point. He helped me rent a scooter, which I highly recommend for getting around the island as there isn't a ton within walking distance of the homestay. Plenty of fresh seafood, and the homestay has all the food, water and drinks you need at reasonable prices. Highly recommend the nearby Ray Ong Bang Cafe and Monkey Beach Bar. Room is about as basic as they come, but the air conditioning works very well and the shared bathroom is functional. You can request a key to lock your door when you leave. Great for a super laid back experience living with a local family in a sleepy little fishing village at a very good price. Thank you so much!"

          "comments": "This homestay might be the highlight of our whole trip. The homestay is located in the smaller town on the island, which made it feel very local and quiet. The people in this town are amazing loving people, which was also the reason why we ended up enjoying our stay. Mamma Hai and Mamma Nhi (two sisters with their own homestays working together) were such nice people and made us feel like we were at home. Hai’s son, Tony, is the person behind the whole “operation”. He is very kind and helpful and quick to respond if you need anything. The homestay also offers different private activities, and I would definitely recommend taking their snorkeling tour, instead of the touristy ones you find in the main harbor. This is a place I will remember for life, and our experience here is very special for us. Thank you to everyone for giving us these memories."

They will heat up some water in a bucket for you to dip into to wash if you wish.  There was nothing mentioned about this & we were quite unprepared for that.<br/>As you are supposed to remove your shoes when going inside,<br/>going barefoot into the 1 bathroom (the other has sandals to use) was gross, & the floor was frequently wet.  It's best to bring some inside sandals.<br/>Bedroom doors aren't locked from the outside unless you bring your own padlock."

The space is quiet, surrounded by greenery, and filled with natural light. It’s just a few minutes by car, motorbike, or bicycle to the Ancient Town. The ride takes you through peaceful rice fields where you might even see some Vietnamese water buffalo along the way – such a unique experience! The host was incredibly kind and helpful. I’ll always remember this lovely home and will definitely come back next time I’m in Hoi An."

Spotlessly clean and fresh. <br/>Finally, Thanh herself was endlessly friendly and gave excellent recommendations for the surrounding area. <br/>A perfect retreat for anyone, could not recommend highly enough."

It was raining when I stayed there, but it still made me feel so comfortable. The room was clean and well organized, the host was all kind and gentle, and their communication was very good. It's a wonderful place that makes you feel like you're going home when you come back from Hoi An. It became such a place that I would definitely like to come back soon!"

The atmosphere was peaceful, the hosts were kind, and the location couldn’t be more convenient. Definitely felt like a home away from home.<br/>The only thing that held me back from giving a full 5 stars was the blanket — it felt a bit… underdressed? 😅 Almost like it forgot to show up with its stuffing. A fluffier one would’ve made those chilly nights 10/10!<br/>But overall, I would totally come back and recommend it to friends. With just a little upgrade in blanket department, this place would be chef’s kiss. 💫"

Very nice village with the right size that one could enjoy the beach and find everything needed, meanwhile being authentic. It felt very safe as well. <br/>We are a family traveling with a 4 months old baby, the host was kind enough to set up a baby crib in the room. <br/>The apartment is nicely constructed, everything functions very well. Some small issues were resolved very fast by the concierge lady Thuong proactively. <br/>We’d love to stay there again during our next holiday in Hoi An. And we’d love to spend holiday at the village around An Bang beach again."

          "comments": "This place is a beautiful new apartment, with such nice design. The art, the colours, the location. My friend and I shared for a week, during a nomad festival that was held locally. The area was so quiet and a nice sanctuary to go back to after long days. Only a couple of minutes to walk to the beach. Plenty of food options (hit up Thom’s Sourdough!) and it’s a very walkable area with chill vibe. <br/>Despite it being a new apartment, there isn’t an exhaust fan in the small bathroom, so it ends up like a steam room and gets really wet. The humidity of Hoi A picked up this week as well and it was evident by the end of the week that there was mould spores. We had mould growing on a few of our belongings, so hopefully they are able to get on top of this.<br/>Thuong was really easy to communicate with and was proactive with this.<br/>Overall, we loved our stay and wished we could have stayed longer. Would stay there again if they address the potential mould issue."

Any minor issues that came up were addressed almost immediately, which made us feel really well looked after.<br/>Great location - right across the street from a gym, walking distance to several fantastic cafés, and in a generally peaceful area. The dryer in the building was a huge bonus for us and made our stay even more convenient.<br/>The apartment was very clean when we arrived — the cleaners did an excellent job. While it wasn’t quite as polished as the photos made it look, it was still comfortable, well-kept, and excellent value for money. The walls are a bit thin, but the building itself is usually quiet and has a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.<br/>Overall, a great stay, wonderful value, and we’d happily book again!"

You have two bedrooms, one is so big you can literally dance around it. The place is clean, worth the price and comfortable.<br/>It's also near Bac My An Market where avocado ice cream was sold and a lot of commodities. Literally just 10 steps away was a 24/7 convenience store, and 2 blocks away is a pharmacy and also sense coffee which we had to visit 3x because their mousakka was so good, we literally ate it 3 days straight (and the pizza + coffee)<br/>We will recommend them to our friends and everyone who's going to ask about a nice place to stay."

From the moment we arrived, the owner was incredibly welcoming and made sure we felt right at home by assisting us to self check-in. It’s clear that they genuinely care about their guests and take pride in providing good  service. <br/>The place is spacious and well-maintained, offering spacious of room to relax and room around, If you come in a group of 10 but booked only for 4, you can do that you just have to ask for extra matres. The amenities comes as what has been written in the list like free drinking water, hot bath, washing area– everything you could possibly need is right there. Whether it’s the fully-equipped kitchen, fast Wi-Fi, cozy lounge with balcony area, everything exceeded my expectations.<br/>We also appreciated how clean and comfortable the rooms were, making it easy to enjoy my time there. The location is also convenient.<br/>Overall, we would high-recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing and hassle-free stay."

Super secure too—gated with a guard and outposts around the property.<br/>There’s a jacuzzi (I think), but one of the valves was missing so I couldn’t get it working as a jacuzzi. Still used it as a nice tub though. Honestly, the place is already a solid 10, but a working jacuzzi after a long day exploring Old Town Hoi An would’ve made it a 100 lol."

The place was huge and spotlessly clean.   <br/>It was the perfect place for downtime before our flight… with a key board and a guitar that our teenage daughters enjoyed playing. There was also a great bahn mi stall right in front of the gate, perfect for a quick snack!  <br/>Next time we are in Da Nang, we hope to stay longer."

The host was very responsive and helpful, which truly stood out.<br/>However, several issues affected our comfort.<br/>1. The ground floor toilet's flush tank didn’t work.<br/>2. We were greeted by black ants on arrival. A dead cockroach was found in the bedroom, pointing to the need for pest control—tropical climate shouldn't be the only excuse.<br/>3. Bedroom AC units cooled slowly, and without a centralized system, the living room became too hot to enjoy.<br/>4. A dressing mirror is missing in the upper bedroom; the small one in the bathroom isn't adequate.<br/>5. Musical instruments add a lovely vibe, but the heat makes it hard to enjoy them for long.<br/>The property has great potential with its spacious layout and creative touches. With better attention to maintenance and cooling, it could easily become one of the more comfortable and enjoyable stays nearest to Airport area. Close proximity to Airport is a big plus. Thankyou 😊"

It is recommended to rent a scooter, because cocohut is located in a quiet neighborhood where construction is still going on. Certainly in the low season there are a few less facilities than in the rest of Hoi An. But with the scooter / grab you are everywhere. And the host helps very nicely with arranging everything. We got a nice small scooter for rent via Johana that tourists can also ride well ;) Our laundry was done very quickly. And Johana is also a very friendly sweet host!"

It is a little far from old town but only a 5-10 minute drive. There is a building behind the Coconut hut that is rather loud at night time so keep this in mind if you want to go to bed at a decent time. The host was communicative and nice."

The check in was simple and went as smoothly as it could’ve gone. Johanna didn’t hesitate to help us with anything we needed and was always friendly and welcoming. Only thing that wasn’t great was that the neighbors seem to be very fond of karaoke but that’s got nothing to do with the air bnb itself. Overall this is a really great deal and I recommend it wholeheartedly."

The design was charming and made for a memorable stay.<br/>That said, it's worth noting that the walls are quite thin, so you can hear a lot of noise from outside and from neighboring huts. The space is also pretty tight, which can feel a bit claustrophobic, so I’d only recommend it for a short stay.<br/>The host was very responsive and made the whole process smooth and pleasant. If you’re looking for something different and don't mind close quarters or a bit of outside noise, it’s a great pick!"

Inside, it was incredibly clean with beautiful interior design and quality shower products.<br/>The hosts were extremely attentive and fulfilled all our requests, including extra dishes, drinking water, and even laundry capsules — all provided promptly.<br/>Cleaning was flawless — truly hotel-level quality.<br/>If you’re looking for comfort and genuine care, this is definitely a place worth coming back to!"

          "comments": "It's hard finding a spacious place in Da Nang that actually matches the photos. We had a string of bad experiences on Airbnb with other listings in Da Nang but this one was very good. The host was communicative and fixed issues (both bathroom shower drains did not drain properly over multiple days) when we told them. There is a distinctive sewer smell that comes from the drains at random times during the day and night but this is to be expected in the cities where there is no sewer gas cover. We closed the bathroom doors and it was fine. High reccomend this place if you're working remotely or need some room to space out. The location was far from beach / better areas of town but you can easily rent a scooter or get a Grab cheaply."

I slept with my feet at that end, but it's still a bit uncomfortable. the room is very small, so I would only recommend a short stay.<br/>Again, it's great value if you're on a budget, but I would recommend paying more for something bette"

Соседские птицы так мило болтают. Ресторан работает во время завтрака и вы выбираете все, что вам понравится из предлагаемых вариантов. Ванная комната безупречно чистая. Простыни белоснежные.

The property is beautifully furnished with three spacious bedrooms, each with its own attached washroom, ensuring plenty of privacy and convenience for our big family. The home was equipped with everything we needed, and the internet connectivity was excellent throughout, which was a big plus for everyone.<br/>What made this stay extra special was the incredible hospitality of the host. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, even arranging to pick up our large family upon arrival, which was such a thoughtful gesture. Their care and attention to detail made us feel right at home, and they were always available to assist with any questions or requests.<br/>The location was also ideal — peaceful yet close to all the key attractions in Da Nang. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. 5⭐️"

          "comments": "We stayed at this 4-story house for nearly a week, and everything exceeded our expectations. The house features 3 bedrooms, 5 beds, 3 bathrooms, 1 restroom, and a beautiful kitchen and dining area that looks even better than the pictures.<br/>The house is cozy and thoughtfully designed in a modern Euro-American style, offering all the necessary amenities you could think of. The attic room, designed for children, has bunk beds and a bit of noise from the water pump, but all the other conveniences made our stay so comfortable that any minor inconvenience was quickly forgotten.<br/>The location is central, making it easy to get around, and it’s near the airport without any noise disturbance from airplanes. Every detail of the house is meticulously decorated, from the dishes and glasses to the flower vases—it’s as beautiful as a painting.<br/>The host was incredibly supportive and attentive throughout our stay. If I could, I would give her 10 stars! Highly recommended for the family or group."

They were all great, but one had a strong smell of mildew and there was some mold in the freezer. Otherwise very clean and such lovely responsive host and staff. Also some cafes nearby so you don't have to walk everywhere!"

It appeared that they did not have a pan big enough for us to cook dinner yet. 30 minutes later they had purchased a new pan for us and delivered it personally. The place itself is also great. It has everything you need for a long-term stay. We had a great stay and would recommend it to everyone."

В пешей доступности множество уютных кафе и ресторанов. Мы были с маленьким ребенком, нам требовалось около 12 минут чтобы дойти до пляжа. Сама квартира новая. Очень удобно что в есть стиральная машина с сушилкой. Хорошие кровати и кондиционер. Мы хорошо высыпались, так как было достаточно тихо. Если резюмировать это отличное соотношение цены и качества."

It was the perfect base for exploring the city and nearby beaches.<br/>The unit itself was immaculate—clean, simple, and compact, yet very comfortable and well-designed for 2–4 people. The washer and dryer in the unit were a huge plus for longer stays, and the air conditioning was powerful and reliable—a lifesaver during the heat wave!<br/>The hosts were responsive, friendly, and provided excellent local recommendations that really enhanced our trip. Overall, a great stay—highly recommended for anyone looking for convenience, comfort, and a seamless experience in Da Nang. Thanks team! 😊"

The host was incredibly friendly and understanding, letting me check in a bit early and check out later, and was always happy to help with anything, including laundry. The room was comfortable, with a soft bed and clean sheets, and having a private beach and pools was a huge plus. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a relaxing and welcoming stay!"

We had access to the pools (the resort has a kid pool) which we really liked but didn't use because of the weather. The place is off the center, close to the beach. The host was helpful and responsive to all of our questions. We'd highly recommend this place."

Các trò chơi được thiết kế an toàn, phù hợp với nhiều độ tuổi, giúp các con của tôi thoải mái<br/>Với dịch vụ chất lượng, cơ sở vật chất hiện đại và tiện ích đa dạng, chắc chắn chúng tôi sẽ tiếp tục lựa chọn nó trong những chuyến đi sắp tới và giới thiệu cho nhiều người khác."

One of our highlights is the kitchen (we missed cooking for ourselves) and and air fryer (which you need to have an adapter for as it doesn’t plug into the wall, luckily we did!). They had a water purification system that was clean and did not make us sick! Thanh Huyên was responsive and helpful during our stay. I have nothing but good things to say about this place and its surroundings! An Bang beach was a 25-30 minute walk away which had a lot of different restaurant options. Loved the 3 different pools, private beach access, and of course happy hour from 3-5 PM where you can buy 1 get 1 free for draft and basic cocktails! If we ever get the chance, we will be back."

The host kindly allowed us to check in early, and the apartment was spotless, beautifully decorated, and even included noodles for late-night snacks—a thoughtful touch.<br/>The resort offered plenty of amenities to make our visit enjoyable. Every morning, a breakfast buffet was available. While it wasn’t included, it was well worth the price and stayed open until late. The resort also had two restaurants, a sky bar with stunning views, and a small pub where you could unwind with drinks, play pool, table soccer, or table tennis.<br/>The gym was accessible to all guests, and the beach was just a short walk away—easy to access and perfect for a sunny day (though we couldn’t enjoy it due to the weather). The resort also featured multiple pools, including a kiddies pool for families with young children.<br/>The host communicated promptly, was gracious throughout our stay, and made everything seamless. I’d absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it!"

The bed was very comfortable, which was a rare find during our trip. It truly felt like home – clean, cozy, and with a lovely room setting that made us feel relaxed from the moment we arrived. Hot water was available to shower. <br/>The host was very responsive. For the price, this homestay offered amazing value. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, homey, and convenient place to stay."

It is at the end of a rather long, narrow alley and there is no way to be dropped off at the door with luggage. I suggested having two positions to hang the bathroom mirror as it is far too low for an adult male North American. Working around the door in the bathroom is a bit of a nuisance, but considering how little I paid, I just accepted it."

They even gave me a list of go-to places to eat ❤️ They clean the rooms every day and they change the towels too. The room was spacious and you can connect your phone/device to the TV and speaker. Even if it's beside the street, I didn't get bothered by the honk of the cars early in the morning (well, I worked at around 5am so I'm wide awake when they start coming! so if you're sensitive to the bustling noise of traffic, maybe request a room that's not facing the street. overall, I loved my stay and would definitely book here again when I come back to Da Nang ❤️"

The owners were always available to help with anything – from booking tours and transportation to offering great local recommendations. I felt like staying home.<br/>The location was perfect, very close to the old town, walkable to everywhere but enough to feel peaceful and private.<br/>If you’re planning a trip to Hoi An and want a relaxing, peaceful and authentic place to stay, look no further. This homestay is a hidden gem, and I can’t wait to return!"

Jin is always helpful and gives great restaurant recommendations and points of interest to make your stay in Da Nang the best ever! i would highly recommend her place to anyone and i can’t wait to go back! ❤️"

Jin was so welcoming and made sure we had all we need. She had us taken from the airport (with a small fee) and checked us in even when it was late at night. She gave me recommendations on nearby restos, massage places, and accessible beaches :) She answered every query swiftly, and she was so kind about it 🥹 <br/>The price is worth it! Easily accessible by grab, too. And Jin’s neighbor Than became a friend as well as he took us to several places on his taxi (with a fee ofc). Hope to meet them again!"

Their hospitality was truly exceptional—they treated me more like family than just a guest.<br/>The space was spotless, well-maintained, and had everything I needed for a relaxing stay. But what really made my experience special was their kindness and attention to detail. Whether it was offering great local recommendations or simply checking in to make sure I had everything I needed, they truly cared about my experience.<br/>If you're looking for a warm, welcoming place to stay in Da Nang, look no further. I can't recommend Jin and Kim enough and would gladly stay here again!"

The quality of the house is really good, especially if you take in to consideration that the house is located out in the countryside. You have all that you need in the house, but there are only a few small and really local shops and restaurants nearby so you might consider to bring your own food to the house or be prepared to use Grab or similar for home delivery. The hostess is really friendly, replies quickly, helps with transport and other things you might need or have questions about."

There were also a few creepy crawlies and a mouse running around but besides that, it was an ok stay. Convenient location if you want to stay near the Sunworld theme park."

Took a cab and we were alone in the middle of nowhere in the pitch dark for 30 minutes i safely walking around fields. Luckily a local family saved us, helped us find the real address on google and took us there on bikes. Nissi wasn’t contactable at the time. When we arrived we realised the house is in front of a garbage dump and smells bad at night. The house itself is ok, towels weren’t good and the toilet and shower is outside also the kitchen is like a shop with lots of things for sale not complimentary. We were rented a bike which saved us one day but we cut our stay short because we felt it didn’t match the description. The address is probably deliberately off by 5km so you don’t check the local area"

We even ended up skipping some of our tours just to relax at the beach & pool. This is a luxury hotel and we felt lucky to book it while still enjoying the same amenities as hotel guests. We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights, but honestly, it felt too short. I wish we had adjusted our itinerary and stayed longer.<br/>Even though I knew the king-size bed might be a bit tight for the 3 of us, I still chose this place because it’s a beachfront  at a very affordable price. It would have been nice if there was a sofa bed, though.<br/>There were some minor issues like the room key card not working, getting charged for a towel that got stained & a small hiccups when our Grab dropped us off at the hotel entrance we weren’t informed that our lobby was in the last building. But all of these were outweighed by the overall wonderful experience at Wyndham Resort and I still give it a 5 star rating⭐️"

I was warmly welcomed with complimentary coffee — although I’m allergic to caffeine, I truly appreciated the kind gesture.<br/>The room was very new and clean, and the overall atmosphere of the resort was peaceful and private, located right by the beach. One small note is that guests need to bring their own towels when going to the swimming pool, and the washing machine couldn’t dry my clothes — or perhaps I didn’t know how to use it properly.<br/>Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would love to come back again if I have the chance."

          "comments": "This place exudes a calm, rustic charm that invites introspection and slow living. The traditional elements — from the wooden furniture to the calligraphy curtains — blend beautifully with the soft natural light, creating a deeply serene atmosphere. Whether you’re journaling by the window or enjoying tea on the floor seating, it’s the kind of space that gently quiets the mind and nurtures creativity. It feels like a retreat for the soul — warm, thoughtful, and quietly poetic. The host is very friendly, thoughtful and enthusiastic"

Too long to walk from the airport with all the luggage (it looks right next door on the map, but the path for pedestrians winds all the way around), so just pay $2 for a grab. <br/>Excellent host & room was as described. All staff were very friendly & helpful. <br/>The only knock would be that the bathroom window didn't have a screen (none of the windows in Vietnam do), so your options were to either be eaten alive by mosquitoes (I got some big bug bites my first night; not a great way to start the trip) or not properly vent the bathroom. There was no fan and the window to the bathroom was facing the hall/main staircase of the homestay so people in other rooms or walking by above can see and hear inside your bathroom. <br/>Binh was super helpful and responsive."

Every detail was thoughtfully arranged, and the atmosphere was peaceful and welcoming.<br/>A special mention to the villa manager—she was incredibly kind, helpful, and always available, no matter the time. From assisting with small things to going out of her way to make us comfortable, her hospitality was exceptional. She truly made our experience unforgettable.<br/>The location is great, and everything was smooth from check-in to check-out. We were very, very satisfied with everything—villa, staff, cleanliness, service, and comfort. It was one of the best Airbnb stays we’ve ever had!<br/>If you’re planning a trip to Da Nang, we highly recommend Coco Villa 3. A perfect mix of beauty, comfort, and warm hospitality. We would love to return again soon. Huge thanks to the amazing host!"

          "comments": "Wir durften einige Tage in einer traumhaft schönen Villa verbringen – mit liebevoll eingerichteten Details, einem großen Außenbereich und einer gemütlichen Außenküche, in der wir morgens ganz in Ruhe frühstücken konnten. Das Bett war super bequem, der Ort absolut ruhig und friedlich – fern vom Trubel der Stadt, aber trotzdem perfekt gelegen: Nur 5 Minuten mit dem Roller zum Strand und etwa 15 Minuten ins Stadtzentrum.<br/>Ein ganz besonderes Highlight war Jin. Sie war nicht nur eine Gastgeberin – sie wurde für uns in kurzer Zeit zu einer Freundin. Mit ihrer offenen, hilfsbereiten und herzlichen Art hat sie uns sofort ein Zuhause-Gefühl gegeben. Sie war jederzeit erreichbar, hatte tolle Tipps parat und hat sich mit so viel Hingabe um alles gekümmert. Ein Abend mit ihr voller inspirierender Gespräche bleibt uns besonders in Erinnerung.<br/>Es fiel uns wirklich schwer, wieder abzureisen. Diese Unterkunft ist ein Herzensort, und wir können sie aus tiefstem Herzen weiterempfehlen. Danke für alles ?"

It faced the afternoon sun but the air conditioner compensated. Complimentary breakfast was a good deal; did not have to travel for morning coffee or meal. Finally, the cleaning staff was always very friendly even when busy with cleaning rooms. I would definitely stay again."

I loved the convenience of the location (close to many cafes, tailors, and Old Town), the small touches such as breakfast being included and the staff being super friendly, and the quiet and peaceful surroundings. The front desk helped me book a car to the airport at a fair price, and was always there to help me with any services I might need (such as luggage storage). Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in Hoi An for a reasonable price."

The staff were so lovely from the second we arrived, with fruit and orange juice by the pool on our arrival. Breakfast every morning was the best food we had experienced in Vietnam (make sure to try the Cao Lau) with everything grown locally - you could taste the difference and it was absolutely incredible.<br/>Our room was just beautiful, photos don’t even do Little Pie justice as it’s just so special. Make sure you take the time to visit their beautiful cafe located 15 scooter away, the most amazing treats and relaxing area - we loved playing with puppy Chay and kittens everyday.<br/>The location also is a dream, located in Vegetable Village - we couldn’t have asked for a better stay. We can’t wait to come back again and again. Thank you so much to Pham and the team for everything 🤍"

Fresh flowers, cats, tasty food for breakfast and the silence!!!!!!!  Everything I was looking for. The room came with a steam iron, hair dryer,House slippers. Easy laundry service for a minimum price. The breakfast was tasty healthy and filling. Ben who helped us was absolutely sweet. Tree and Pham are such nice ppl. Wish both of them the very best. Tree is an awesome artist and it reflects in every corner of the house. So glad I found this place. They have one in Hanoi too, can’t wait to stay there too."

There is everything you need in the apartment! <br/>They gave us amazing recommendations about sightseeings, restaurants and bike rental! They were very helpful and kind!<br/>Thank you so much, we are definitely coming back someday!"

About 20-25 minute walk to the main DaNang beach. Plenty of local places to eat on the main road. Not quiet, there is a boxing studio downstairs, but it is one of the most quiet places we’ve had in Vietnam. The host communicates very well, even brought me a dessert for international women’s day."

We appreciated having a kitchen with clean dishes and nice appliances like a rice cooker, electric stove and large fridge with a freezer. Also there's a clothes washing machine in the bathroom. Linh was very accommodating, arranged furniture in the apartment before our arrival and helped us rent a motorbike. Location is on the southern end of the city not far either the riverfront or beach. It is a quieter part of town, but there are still plenty of restaurants within walking distance and a 24hr convenience store on the same block. You will be in good hands if you stay here the hosts are incredibly responsive and friendly. Glad we got to stay somewhere so nice for a month!"

I liked the kitchen and amenities – even a microwave oven – which is a great plus!<br/>I also liked that the bathroom had a separate place for the shower – so you don't take a shower near the toilet and have water everywhere in the floor.<br/>The bed was huge!<br/>The window doesn't look at the wall.<br/>So, I definitely recommend it!"

There's also a small but lovely balcony, perfect for enjoying a morning coffee.<br/>Linh and Binh are very attentive and professional. They helped me rent a motorbike and even shared super useful lists of places to visit via WP. I can also say they are kind and respectful people.<br/>The house is located in a developing, quiet, and safe neighborhood. As far as I know, many digital nomads and tourists stay around here. It's not super close to the beach, but I walked there a few times with no problem. Grab rides are quick and convenient anyway. Plus, being in the center of the island means you're equally close to many different spots.<br/>I was really happy with both the place and the hosts. Highly recommended!"

It truly felt like home from the moment we arrived. The kitchen was spacious and fully equipped, perfect for cooking and gathering. The swimming pool was the absolute highlight—sparkling clean, relaxing, and a dreamy escape both day and night. What made our stay even more special was the host—easily the best we’ve ever had! Incredibly responsive, kind, and attentive to every need. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Can’t wait to return!"

Lorsqu’une fuite est survenue dans notre chambre à cause de fortes pluies, il a immédiatement trouvé une solution en nous relogeant dans une autre chambre. J’ai également dû modifier plusieurs fois les dates de notre séjour, et il a toujours fait preuve d’une grande flexibilité. Et pour couronner le tout, il nous a offert un cadeau avant notre départ, un geste que nous avons beaucoup apprécié. Merci encore pour tout, je recommande les yeux fermés ! 🥰🥰"

Thuý asked if there’s anything else I need, and I answered, “Everything we need is here — actually more than what we need. Really great place!”<br/>It’s extremely peaceful here as it is tucked in a minor road BUT only a few meters upon exiting the property, there’s already the bustling Hoi An where ATMs, street-side coffee, spas, etc. are — all conveniently within walking distance.<br/>The property bicycles are free for guests’ use and if you opt to rent a scooter, Thuý has a contact for very reasonable scooter rental fee — cheaper than the ones you find outside.<br/>After hours of walking/cycling around Hoi An, each night I relax in the al fresco bath and get a very restful sleep in their very soft bed.

Breakfast was exceptionally good, with nine different menus to choose from. The staff members were super friendly and went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable — really appreciated that!<br/>Chloe, the co-host, was very flexible and did her best to accommodate us in every way possible. If you decide to stay at this villa, she’ll be more than happy to help with activities like tours, motorbike rentals, and more. Moreover, the swimming pool was perfect for our family to have fun. We’ll definitely stay here again in the future. Appreciate you all! highly recommend!"

Die Unterkunft war genauso, wie in der Beschreibung angegeben, sehr sauber, liebevoll eingerichtet und mit allem ausgestattet, was man für einen angenehmen Aufenthalt braucht.<br/>Die Lage war ideal, ruhig und trotzdem gut angebunden, mit Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants in der Nähe. Besonders angenehm war der reibungslose Check-in und die freundliche Kommunikation mit dem Chloe 💕🌸🥰. Wir haben uns von Anfang an sehr willkommen gefühlt.<br/>Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen und können diese Unterkunft mit bestem Gewissen weiterempfehlen. Vielen Dank für die tolle Gastfreundschaft und ein großes Dankeschön an das gesamte Team. Ihr seid wirklich klasse 🫶🤩"

One thing to note is that the balcony for our room opened to the inside of the building, it was not very clear from the photos that this would be the case, so if you want a balcony to smoke on this wouldn't work for that.<br/>The staff are all very friendly, breakfast is excellent with many options that change each day, and they offer free snacks and fruit for you to take with you.<br/>I would definitely stay here again if I came to Da Nang again."

The staff was really friendly and helpful and the room was clean and as spacious as expected. <br/>The hotel is in a great location, and in 5min you are at the beach. The hotel offers you beach towels and offers to keep your room key while you go swimming at the beach, which is really convenient. <br/>The highest aspect for us was the breakfast, really nice and delicious options. Really recommend this accommodation! :)"

We enjoyed the bath tub, the toilet is so aesthetically pleasing. We have a small balcony. Air-conditioning is very good as well as the Wifi - good for those who are working. What we love the most was the breakfast!! So delicious and healthy! All staffs are friendly and welcoming, helped us with our luggage. There’s an elevator but very narrow. The place is accessible with everything, spas, pharmacy, restaurants and the beach! We will surely come back!"

The host's aunt nextdoor cooks wonderful meals and the hospitality is unmatched! The view from the house is nice with a cool temple and some ocean in view as well! The beach is so close! Walk outside and there it is! You should definatly hire a little round boat to take you snorkeling just a short ways to the south! The coral is amazing and you can see why this island is protected! I will stay here again when I return to Cham for another round of island paradise!"

It’s a nice beach front studio house 1 big bedroom with 2 queen beds, 1 bathroom. Perfect for couple or family.<br/>Good food is server from Papa and Mama next door and local restaurant nearby.<br/>Beach is nice and beautiful just 50m walk from the house, good coffee shop is 100m. <br/>The village is nice and peaceful. I really enjoyed my stay here and will come back for a longer vacation."

Papa took us on a snorkelling trip to a private beach which was a great way to snorkel without coming into contact with all of the tour groups. They helped us to rent sup boards and a motorbike too! They couldn’t have done enough and the overall friendly and family feel was just very warm and welcoming. The location is great- very local vibes but still close to some great beaches! Host was so lovely- they have lots of recommendations and even called to make sure our stay was going well. We will definitely return! Highly recommend for a peaceful visit to Cham island away from all of the tour groups."

A highlight for my partner and I was the free breakfast every morning, with a variety of delicious food and fresh fruit. Bao organised a free airport pick up for us also and gave many recommendations for places to visit and eat. Old town is only a 10 min motorbike ride away, and bikes were provided for free. Highly recommend this stay!"

We especially loved the private pool and the sunken indoor hot tub, which made every evening feel like a spa retreat. We felt completely relaxed from the moment we arrived.<br/>The service was outstanding. Each morning started with a generous and delicious complimentary breakfast, and the free laundry service was a thoughtful bonus. Since we stayed 6 nights, we also received free airport pickup and drop-off, which made our arrival and departure completely stress-free.<br/>Bao was an exceptional host—kind, responsive, and genuinely committed to making our stay perfect. His communication was clear and caring, and we felt truly looked after. We left with full hearts and can’t wait to return!"

A big shout out to all of the staff on site, they always had a smile and were super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent and nothing was too much trouble for them, great extras included free laundry service and airport pick up and drop off. We will definitely return to Palm Villa on our next trip to Vietnam, we would highly recommend Bao’s Villa’s we are sure you will enjoy it as much as we did!"

Tư vấn cho chúng tôi từ bữa sáng cho đến các địa điểm du lịch vô cùng chi tiết.<br/>Bữa sáng ở đây thực sự là một điểm không thể nào chê được. Nó quá ngon!!!. Ngoài ra, chúng tôi còn được 1 ly đồ uống rất ngon nữa. Không những thế, giặt đồ hoàn toàn miễn phí. Điều này đỡ cho chúng tôi rất nhiều khoản chi phí ( vì tôi mang không nhiều quần áo ha ha )<br/>Đây chính là kì nghỉ hè đáng nhớ nhất của tôi. Cảm ơn Coco Villa 6 và Trang đã cho tôi 1 kì nghỉ hè tuyệt vời."

Hoi An old town was just fifteen mins in a cab. <br/>Our host was very friendly, flexible and proactive, but we had total privacy for our stay. He also made some local recommendations, which turned out to be some of the best experiences of our whole Asia trip. <br/>I would strongly recommend staying here if you have the chance, and I plan to do so again myself when I have the chance."

Tæt på indkøb og gode små restauranter, et skønt kvarter.<br/>Manager på huset var yderst hjælpsom.

If you’re a bigger group you can book both apartments. <br/>The decor is very tastefully done and there is a living space as well as separate bedroom, bathroom and kitchen with facilities for self catering. Washing machine also available. Living and bedroom space have ceiling fan and a/c. <br/>Location is just super, on a quiet laneway away from the Main Street, and a 2 min walk to the beach. Also at quieter end of the beach too. Host is very responsive and can book airport taxi and tours, and has all the local spots to eat. If flying in, arrange airport taxi before arriving for easy transfer. Very responsive to messages. <br/>A great stay had."

The place is 50 meters to A Bang beach (so much better than Da Nang beach! And a good place for morning walks/jog and a cold plunge - we came here Feb!) and restaurants, mini mart, coffee shops, open market are all walking distance. <br/>The house was perfect for us! It’s the little things that matter - they have yoga mat and weights for early morning exercise and stretching before hitting the beach for morning run, wide smart tv if you want to relax at night, the bathroom has a washing machine and a lot of hangers to dry clothes, a working desk with extension cord and a really good wifi (100mbps), a bread knife (!) to cut sourdough bread, cooking utensils are complete! <br/>Linh also is the best host, her restaurant recommendations are always on point - we wanted local taste, not a lot of tourists, and she really gave us good places to eat! Always responsive!!!"

We reached quite late and Dilhan helped us get inside without any hassle. It’s a beautiful house with all the amenities. The rooms were beautiful. It’s great for a long stay, especially for a large group. The beach is very close and Hoi An town is a 15 min Grab ride. Lot of eating places nearby and convenience stores."

Lots of amenities close at hand and only 10 mins in a taxi or 45 min speed march to Hue town centre. <br/>Most will probably want to appreciate what both distinct areas have to offer and if you do visit Hoi An old town, have a look for Chickpea Restaurant, as they offer amazing cookery courses. <br/>The accommodation is set up so you can take the whole house or just a room, and still get the same access to the kitchen, living space. Colonial style decor, but befitting of the area. <br/>We loved Hoi An's relaxed vibe."

A leisurely stroll took me straight to the beach, and I was spoiled for choice with cafés and restaurants around the place.

The villa's location is just perfect—mere steps away from the serene beach, and surrounded by an exciting array of cafes and bars, offering a taste of the vibrant local scene.<br/>The real highlight, though, has to be the comfort of the accommodation. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a deeply restful night's sleep after our days spent exploring and enjoying the sun. It's clear that no detail has been overlooked in making sure guests have everything they need to relax and rejuvenate.<br/>Big thanks to the Hoi An Beach Villa team for making our stay so memorable. We can't wait to return!"

On the other hand, if you are not used to traffic noise, it feels too loud because of vivid Da Nang life below in the main street but closing windows and using AC or fans helps.

Khoa was helpful all the way through, writes I'm perfect English, so no communication troubles – which is amazing.<br/>The apartment is just as it's in the pictures, maybe a little restoration needed, because of a lot of rains in Da Nang.<br/>Overall, we were absolutely happy to live there and very thankful to Khoa ❤️"

Neatly tucked away behind picturesque views, while still within a 2 minute grab from all of the many sights and restaurants found in the cities old town.

The host was warm and clearly passionate about life—the welcome fruit and breakfast they provided were delicious!  <br/>That said, due to the natural surroundings, there were quite a few insects in the room (spiders, geckos, etc.), which might be unavoidable given the location. Also, the walls are a bit thin, so we could hear the neighbor’s roosters in the morning.  <br/>Overall, a unique and cozy stay—just be prepared for a rustic touch!"

Every detail, from flower arrangements, to choice of furniture, & table ware was so thoughtful. The Airbnb feel like a destination itself. <br/>The breakfast menu had a good selection - local to western food, with a variety of drinks and fruits. It prepped me well for day ahead & I always look forward to it."

          "comments": "I booked this homestay while recovering from surgery, hoping for a supportive environment. Communication was poor from the start—Pham ignored the messesger service WA  and insisted on using Istgm , even for urgent matters. Breakfast was paid for but withheld the first day due to a bizarre ordering system she failed to explain. When I missed it again due to post-op pain, I was scolded as “wasteful” rather than checked on. The location was noisy—karaoke and roosters from 3am—and remote, with no mention of this in her listing. Despite agreeing in writing to refund me for unused nights, she later denied it. Airbnb eventually stepped in with a goodwill refund. I was treated rudely, accused of lying, and made to feel unsafe and unwelcome. This is not a warm family homestay—it’s a business focused only on money. I left early and moved to a hotel that was cheaper, more peaceful, and genuinely caring. I would never recommend this stay to anyone, especially those with health needs."

We were 3 so had the 2 rooms/ apartments on the first floor, one with a big balcony at the front with views over the river, the other smaller but both beautiful, clean and with very comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. Thanh and Hannie couldn’t have been more helpful and responded very quickly to messages. You do have to time any arrival and departure by taxi to happen outwith markets times but that’s easy to do and the place is definitely worth it. I would recommend this place 100%."

Everything (restaurants and attractions) was within walking distance, which made it convenient for us to come back for afternoon naps. Most importantly, Thanh’s place was very clean (especially the toilet) and comfortable with an amazing river view. Although we were not able to check in early, we were allowed to leave our luggage in the staff room while waiting. <br/>Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend it to others."

It’s located just steps from the night market and Old Town, making it super easy to explore the city on foot. The design of the studio is minimal yet warm, with beautiful natural touches like wood and clay that made it feel peaceful and unique.<br/>The king-sized bed was incredibly comfortable, and the balcony overlooking the Thu Bon River was such a lovely spot to unwind with tea or a book. The kitchenette had everything I needed to reheat food or make a quick meal, and the bathroom was modern and well-stocked with shampoo, shower gel, and even a hairdryer.<br/>Do note there’s no elevator, so you’ll need to take the stairs to the second floor—but honestly, the peaceful vibe and thoughtful touches more than make up for it. I’d definitely stay here again next time I’m in Hoi An!"

The apartment is spacious, clean, and comes with a cool projector for movie nights. Cara was also kind enough to let us check in as early as 10 AM, which we really appreciated. One of our favorite spots was the aesthetic balcony where we enjoyed our morning coffee while watching the city come to life. If you’re looking for a big, affordable place to stay in Da Nang, I definitely recommend this one!"

The location is perfect with easy access to everything, and the beach is just a short walk away. The host was very responsive and resolved any questions promptly. Highly recommend for a comfortable and convenient stay."

          "comments": "Wow!  This stunning place felt like I was staying in an interior design magazine!  The Zen minimalist design with lovely gardens and tranquil spaces and pool made me want to stay forever!  Not just because of the serene beauty, but also because Quynh has thought of every possible convenience, providing comfort touches such as luxurious bathrobes and great smelling toiletries.   We were especially impressed with the quality bed linens and great pillows - even a special orthopedic neck pillow!The layout of the apartment was wonderful too.  There were three of us staying here (my husband and I, and our friend) and it was great to have two spacious bedrooms, each with its own private full bathroom (complete with garden!). The work desks in each bedroom were great as we needed to do some remote work during our stay and the internet was superb.  Communication with Trinh was fabulous and she was lovely at arranging everything we needed!"

Hien was very friendly and available to answer any questions. At night, the laneway right outside fills with tables of locals eating at a popular chicken and rice restaurant - very vibey! The house feels very authentic and is just a nice place to hand out. Because it’s so old the shower situation is a bit “rustic” but not a major issue."

Clean, comfy bed, and strong WiFi.<br/>The location is also great, near all the restaurants but tucked away from the bustle of ancient town.<br/>The hosts are awesome too. They helped us booked our transfers and were responsive.<br/>This house is a rare find. We were sitting in the ground floor patio and a few people who booked hotels away from ancient town asked us how we found this cute stay. We said Airbnb."

The host was amazingly responsive and helpful, organising bikes, a food tour, Bamboo Circus tickets and a tailor suggestion in advance. We opted for the transfer from Da Nang and were dropped to within 20 metres of the property. Hien checked us in and was a WA message away throughout our stay. Hoi An can get busy at times, but La Maison is an oasis of calm and a short stroll from everything in Hoi An - if you wake up early enough, you can have it all to yourself (mostly)."

It was quite clean, however the upstairs bathroom was in need of some repair with a couple holes in the wall around the shower area and some bugs (although expected in this area). Definitely a learning curve with the shower head- it is only useable as handheld. <br/>We brought bad weather with us as we ended up in a typhoon for most of our stay. Hien, our host, ensured we were dry and safe during this time. We did not get to enjoy the courtyard or balcony as we had hoped.<br/>Our host was very responsive and kind and eager to help with any questions/concerns. The linens and towels appeared a little old but they felt clean. Space was a little tight between me and my mom. I would prefer to stay again by myself."

It was the best place that i have ever stayed so far. I highly recommend this place to other guests to enjoy their time in Hoi An."

Their communication through the Airbnb app was exceptional, consistently going above and beyond.<br/>Whether you're a first-time visitor to Da Nang or returning for another adventure, this is the place you must check out. The location is unbeatable—just a short two-minute walk to the beach, with numerous restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.<br/>I am so thrilled with my experience that I'm sharing this review in English and Korean to ensure that more people discover this fantastic spot. Highly recommended!<br/>관리진과 직원들은 정말로 뛰어납니다. Airbnb 앱을 통한 그들의 소통은 뛰어났으며, 항상 기대 이상으로 최선을 다해주었습니다.<br/>다낭을 처음 방문하는 분이든 다시 방문하는 여행자든, 꼭 이곳을 체크아웃해보세요. 위치는 그야말로 최고입니다—해변까지 단 2분 거리에 있으며, 많은 레스토랑과 바가 가까운 도보 거리에 있습니다.<br/>저는 이곳에서의 경험에 너무 만족해서, 더 많은 사람들이 이 멋진 장소를 발견할 수 있도록 이 리뷰를 한국어와 일본어로 작성하고 있습니다. 강력 추천합니다!"

The place was clean, cozy, and exactly as described in the listing.<br/>The location was definitely the greatest feature close to everything I needed, but still quiet and peaceful at night. Check-in was smooth and communication with the host was easy and quick. The host is also very flexible to accommodate our early baggage drop since we arrived early at Da Nang.<br/>I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Thanks for a great experience!"

Our family had a very comfortable and satisfying stay here. It’s only a few minutes’ walk to the beach.<br/>A very minor downside is that the bathroom in our room didn’t have an exhaust fan, so there was an odor. The lighting setup around the sink area wasn’t ideal, making it a bit inconvenient for getting ready or doing makeup, the light wasn’t bright enough and caused glare when looking in the mirror. However, these are just small issues and didn’t really affect our overall experience. If we have the chance to visit Da Nang again, our family will definitely choose to stay here again!"

Ninh was very helpful and responsive both in person and on the phone whenever we needed anything. <br/>The only downside is that we were staying in the downstairs room that is opposite the pool, so we did not have much privacy as people would sit right outside the doors. This meant we had the curtains shut for much of our stay. If the room has some privacy curtains we could have enjoyed it with sunlight in the room.<br/>The bed is large and very comfortable, and the bathroom is clean with a nice shower. There was no complimentary bottle of water in the rooms but there was a fridge with drinks you could buy. We made good use of the bicycle rental and laundry service. <br/>Overall I would recommend."

The rental option was great and when I requested for a change of motorbike, they were highly responsive in organizing a replacement immediately without any hassle. <br/>Highly recommend this place for all single or couple travellers looking for a great option within few meters to the beach, restaurants, cafes and social hangout areas."

          "comments": "The place is very nice and exactly as shown in the photos. The location is excellent — the beach is very close and there are plenty of dining options nearby. Truc Linh was very helpful; she assisted us in renting a motorbike and even allowed us to store our luggage after check-out, which was very convenient.<br/>One thing to keep in mind: if you prefer to sleep in complete darkness, I recommend turning off the outside lights, as quite a bit of light comes through the windows. The balcony door didn’t close properly, and we noticed a bit of dust on the mirrors and lamps. However, overall everything was great. They also provided bottled water, toothbrushes, and clean towels, which was a nice touch."
