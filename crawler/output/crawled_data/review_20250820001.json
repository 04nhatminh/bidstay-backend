We were amazed that even scissors were available, which had never been seen in all our AirBnB experiences in VN and extremely helpful during our stay. There was a vibe of minimalism, something akin to Japanese simplicity, staying there.<br/>Huy was such a responsive and friendly host, always trying his best to cater to our needs.<br/>The place also has a pool and gym on level 5. Though we don't recommend using the pool during non-summer time."

The only downside is that the accommodation doesn‚Äôt have an elevator, but the staff was super helpful, and the stairs are not too high. You even get free water and refills every day, which is a big plus. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and would love to book again next time I visit Hue."

The soundproofing isn't great either; it can be a bit noisy in the afternoon. That said, it was quiet at night. The curtains in the room aren't ideal, as they don't completely block out exterior light. The room includes a minibar, kettle, coffee and tea bags, and free drinking water. There's a grocery store nearby, along with many nice restaurants. Free bike parking is available outside the hotel. The staff's attention was excellent."

The room was spotless and felt very modern, something that was hard to find in parts of Vietnam. I wish i stayed longer and highly reccomend staying here. It‚Äôs local to lots of restaurants and cafes making it super accessible. I will say it‚Äôs a bit of a drive to the attractions of Hue but the nightlife and surroundings easily cancel out that."

Great location, perfect for accessing the town and surrounding areas and with a great motorbike and scooter rental company just down the street. Their advice was great and helpful and communication was excellent. The apartment is stunning and we wish we could have stayed longer. It‚Äôs a house full of Airbnb apartments perfectly setup with washing facilities and an elevator and parking for bicycles and scooters. The area is quiet and peaceful and very easy to feel at home. We‚Äôd like to extend our thanks to Trang and Ben and their family who were all incredible. Well worth the money and a great place to stay. We look forward to coming back to Hue and staying again."

Not too far from Walking Street at which is great at night. We were satisfied with our stay here üòä"

The only downside was the construction going on that left dust/remnants in the bathroom however the construction only happened during the day. <br/>My only feedback would be to put a handle on the sliding door to get into the bathroom as it was hard to open sometimes. <br/>It was a beautiful little homestay.

The sliding door also does not have a handle which makes it difficult to close.<br/>The air conditioning worked but was noisy so you have to wear earplugs, there was also some building work going on outside which meant that there was some early wake up calls around 7.30-8am<br/>The location was ok and was about a 15-20min walk to the centre, did feel a bit like no man‚Äôs land with not many tourist choices close by.<br/>Check in was simple and communication was good - they did let us leave our baggage with them until we had to get our flight also so not all bad."

Airco aanwezig en er is zelfs een wasmachine die je mag gebruiken, heel handig als je aan het backpacken bent! De communicatie verliep ook supervlot en je kreeg altijd snel antwoord. Zou het zeker aanraden!"

It has a cosy feel and a Vietnamese vibe, love the warm lighting of the house. <br/>There are three rooms in the house, and we shared the same kitchen and dining table, which was actually quite fun, it felt a bit like having housemates.<br/>There are a couple of things I didn‚Äôt love. First, the entry system is a bit inconvenient, the whole house shares one key, and your room card is also used to open the second gate, which can get confusing or tricky to manage. Second, the trash bin in the room is very small, which isn‚Äôt super practical if you‚Äôre staying more than a night or two.<br/>Overall, still a nice stay if you‚Äôre looking for something cosy and local!"

Ben was kind enough to help make arrangements for us to store our luggage as we arrived very early, which we thoroughly appreciated. Exploring around the apartment, you‚Äôre spoilt for choices of food and activities. Cafes, restaurants, and all the hustle bustle is within the closest streets which is very convenient. The room itself is very cosy, with it being very spacious and having all the amenities. There is a great view from the rooftop, as well as access to washing machines which is very helpful.

The apartment is located in a very nice building and the street is less noisy than in the area. The apartment itself matched with the description. The bed is very comfortable, the shower is good too and having a bathtub is a plus. Everything is beautiful decorated, the only thing is that you can't put anything in the bathroom, but it is not really an issue. The air conditioning works well. Overall it is a nice place to stay to visit Hue. There also are plenty of cafes and restaurants near by."

Es war sehr sauber, die Mitarbeiter waren super freundlich und zuvorkommend. Es ist zwar etwas weiter aus der Innenstadt gelegen, allerdings konnten wir hier auch einen Roller mieten mit dem man in 15 min in Hue Mitte sein kann. Erw√§hnen sollte man evtl, dass man seinen Zimmernachbarn sehr h√∂rt, allerdings hatten wir auch Gl√ºck und hatten einen sehr ruhigen Nachbarn. Alles in allem super!"

Directions for everything were clear and the host was very responsive. Hot water was not turned on when we arrived but directions quickly provided. The location is not walkable to much, but grabs were easy to get and there are some small grocery stores just below the building."

Check-in was super easy and host provided clear instructions. Everything was as described. Washer and dryer was a plus as dryers are less common in rentals in Vietnam but so needed with Hue rain and humidity where things take longer to dry! The apartment is in a big complex with people in and out all the time but not located in a touristy area so quiet and peaceful for families! Convenient store and coffee shop right below which was so helpful! The complex has cameras in the halls and host also installed a camera at the front entrance of the door (the latter we didn‚Äôt know but also didn‚Äôt mind). Would definitely book for my own family for future trips!"

The peaceful surroundings made it a relaxing stay, yet it's still very close to the center of Hue, making it super convenient. The host was incredibly helpful, responded quickly to all my messages, and made me feel very welcome. Highly recommend this place if you're visiting Hue!"

So unfortunately left immediately and booked somewhere else as we were too scared. The host tried to reassure us that the spider was harmless but I have never seen a spider so big in my life. The room itself however is lovely - exactly like the pictures. However, due to the indoor/outdoor style I think the spiders find their way in easily."

We really appreciated the contactless check-in. The interior was gorgeous ‚Äî every detail, from the chairs to the shower hidden in the wooden, was wonderful. We got a lot of aesthetic pleasure from it.<br/>The only small downside was the construction nearby, which was a bit disturbing in the morning, but we left early, so it didn‚Äôt bother us too much.<br/>If we ever come back to Hue, we would gladly stay in this house again.<br/>Thank you ü´∂"

Very elevated look compared to its surroundings which in our opinion were a little bit sketchy and a little bit too much outside of town. This is not due to the hosts but to the city. I would recommend staying there if you want something quiet to rest and that has spa-like vibes. The bathroom is the highlight!!!"

The shower is very spacious, and the bathroom is very clean. The relationship between the bedroom and the bathroom is interesting, separated by a sliding door. Both the entrance and the hall are clean and well-maintained. The owners, husband and wife, are very polite. We had a great time at Hu√®! Highly recommended."

Location is in the center, but the road to this home is not busy but feels safe. The communication was really quick and always helpfup. You get an e-mail with instructions in advance, with local tips and how to use laundry etc. which was super helpful. All together, so worth it!"

Das Apartment ist modern und super sauber. Die Gastgeberin war freundlich und zuvorkommend. Bei Nachfragen erhielten wir stets schnell eine Antwort. Klasse Kommunikation!"

Both bedrooms were comfortable, and the AC worked great in every room. The kitchen had everything we needed, and we especially loved the small touches like extra towels and toiletries.<br/>The pool and gym were a huge plus, perfect for relaxing and staying active. The area was quiet and felt very safe, yet still close to cafes, convenience stores, and local food spots. Communication with the host was smooth and helpful throughout.<br/>Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful stay with modern amenities in the city. Would love to come back!"

As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a couple of coffee spots and convenience stores in walking distance, but nothing else, so do expect to be driving to all attractions and restaurants. <br/>The place was very tidy and just as described. There is a partition that separates the main room from the living room and kitchen. May not be a preference if you or your party value privacy. <br/>Overall, beautiful place, great stay and would recommend."

Only 2 minutes walk to the childhood home of Ho Chi Minh! coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Home is pristine and modern and restroom facilities were right outside the door. Phuoc, the host, is super friendly and kind and even gave a personal tour on his motor scooter. Great value for the money, you won't regret it! Cool coffee shop called Green Beans on corner was 5 star as well as Moche coffee bar. Would stay here again!"

The place looks nice, very nice for the price, the location couldnt be better in my opinion, in a quiet neighborhood that sits next to the old royal palace, and you guys won't have much time trying to get to the downtown anyway, around 15 minutes. So yeah for such an affordable price, you'll get a very nice, clean room, placed on a good location as well, definitely recommend it. Oh and the host prepares almost everything and so nice too, nobody will have any problem staying here i promise"

All rooms are very clean and the landlord has artistically decorated the rooms with great attention to detail. The kitchen also has a large refrigerator, a kettle and dishes. In addition, the landlord provides water and coffee free of charge. He gave me very good recommendations for very good local restaurants and coffee shops nearby. He is very friendly and helps with every request. The accommodation is a real insider tip."

Host was present too. <br/>There is a number lock on the main gate. You need to remove your shoes outside and instead use their home slippers. They have raincoat and umbrella.<br/>Our room was on the first floor. Neat & tidy room. Clean Linen. No good view outside the window so better keep it closed.  Host is active on WA and replies back to any query you have within 5-10 mins. There are many places to eat outside closeby. And also they have a kitchen where basic cooking can be done. Coffee sachet are complimentary but u need to pay to use the ready to cook noodles packet. You can get food from outside and keep in fridge and heat later and eat. Our room was quiet big but the washroom tile was slippery and never dried. <br/>Host is very helpful. We loved our stay there."

Ob es eine Empfehlung f√ºr ein Fr√ºhst√ºckscafe, das Organisieren eines Bustickets oder eines Scooters war, er hat mich wirklich toll unterst√ºtzt, zu allem hervorragend Bescheid gewusst und mir dar√ºber hinaus auch wirklich tolle Ratschl√§ge f√ºr meine weitere Reise gegeben.

Good view from the window, a nice shopping center nearby, you can quickly get to any part of the city by taxi, you can also walk nearby. Air conditioners could work a little better, but overall good."

From super mart to coffee shops to big malls, everything is in walkable distance. <br/>I used the gym and pool facilities in the condominium.<br/>Now I come to the best part of this stay, the host, she is such a super host with amazing enthusiasm, with great sense of humour, very helpful, goes out of the way to help guests.<br/>I would definitely stay again if I visit Hue again."

It had plenty of private areas to relax and a charming kitchen just for the guest. The Host and staff was so pleasant and very respectful of privacy. They kept the place immaculate from top to bottom. <br/>I looked forward to coming to a warm inviting home after a long day of visiting attractions. I was there for about a week and enjoyed this homestay for the entirety. I would definitely book again. <br/>Thank you so much for such a pleasant stay!"

Great places and restaurants that perfectly sum up Hu·∫ø! The house was nice and clean. The location itself is good, with a few places to eat and a minimart right across the street. Hu·∫ø city centre and the old imperial city are just a quick 5 minute ride away, either with a scooter or via Grab. Definitely recommend!"

Weitere Restaurants, Bars usw. sind fu√ül√§ufig.<br/>Die Unterkunft bietet alles was man f√ºr einen angenehmen Aufenthalt braucht und uns wurde 2x w√∂chentlich eine Zimmerreinigung angeboten.<br/>Unter dem Zimmer ist direkt das dazugeh√∂rige Caf√®, in dem wir sehr oft Kokosnuss-Kaffe getrunken und enstpannt haben.<br/>Die Kommunikation war super!

Es waren exzellente Caf√©s und Restaurant fu√ül√§ufig zu erreichen. Weiterer Bonus: direkt auf der anderen Seite des Flurs befindet sich der Balkon des Caf√©s mit Blick auf den Fluss, der  zu jeder Tages-und Nachtzeit f√ºr die G√§ste der Unterkunft frei zug√§nglich ist.<br/>F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich war ideal, dass die Unterkunft lediglich 5 Minuten fu√ül√§ufig entfernt ist ü§óüòç"

Pour √©couter un peu de musique c‚Äôest bon, mais si tu voulais √©couter un petit film ‚Ä¶prend toi un chrome cast. <br/>Le caf√© en dessous fait de super bons caf√©s, pas de nourriture. Le coin se fait bien √† pieds (on adore marcher). <br/>Petits restos dans le coin √©galement, belle d√©couverte ! <br/>La chambre est en haut d‚Äôun caf√© et l‚Äôinsonorisation n‚Äôest pas terrible. On entend la musique/les caf√©s se faire faire et il y a une salle pour le caf√© situ√© en avant de la porte de chambre, donc bruyant. Mais d√®s 22h √ßa ferme et √ßa devient tranquille rapidement."

The location is close to the city-center. You can rent a motorbike to get around even more easy. The location above the cafe is great for every coffee enthusiast. Also a cute cafe balcony right across the room, which you have all for yourself in the evening."

The location is very special, in a beautiful nature setting and just across the road from Tu Hieu Pagoda and monastery. For anyone interested in the life and teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh this is an exceptional opportunity. We enjoyed meet8ng other guests - some of whom are long-standibg. Nga was always helpful and warm with her responses and housekeeper Ms Ngi always supportive. Our stay at Pinehill was magical."

The best thing I love is the location, which is within the parameter of Tu Hieu pagoda, where Thay Thich Nhat Hanh became a zen practioner and spend the last years of his life there. Overall highly recommend for people who love quiet, peaceful and mindful place."

El lugar es tal como se ve en las fotos, muy tranquilo y silencioso, nos preocupaba hacer mucho ruido en la noche dado que trabajamos hasta la madrugada, pero no hubo inconveniente. <br/>La familia y el personal es muy amable y atento a todo lo que necesites. Al frente del lugar queda una pagoda muy bonita en donde vale la pena ir a caminar <br/>Es un poco alejado de la ciudad, nosotros rentamos una moto y nos mov√≠amos con facilidad <br/>Gracias por hospedarnos"

The views over the city from the top floor were incredible ‚Äî especially during sunrise and sunset. The living space was cozy yet luxurious, and the balcony filled with greenery was the perfect spot for tea or coffee in the morning.<br/>The host was super helpful and responsive throughout our stay. The apartment is also in a perfect location ‚Äî just minutes from all the major sights in Hu·∫ø.<br/>Highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre traveling with family or a group and want comfort, convenience, and a bit of luxury. Would definitely stay here again!"

We misten wel wat basis voorzieningen in de keuken zoals messen, bestek en weinig borden als je met 5 personen bent.<br/>De locatie is rustig maar toch dichtbij het centrum. Goed te doen met de grab. Op loopafstand van een paar restaurants en koffietentjes. Ook het grote winkelcentrum Aeon dichtbij.<br/>In de foto‚Äôs werd een zwembad en gym afgebeeld maar deze is tegen betaling. Dit was vooraf niet duidelijk gecommuniceerd. Ondanks dat hebben we wel een fijn verblijf gehad, dus ik raad het appartement aan!"

          "comments": "The place is beautiful with all the matching aesthetics you will see. It was a pleasant place to stay. We understand why the host preferred to have a staff member to guide us to the accommodation, as the building itself is big, and if you get in the wrong elevator, your access card won't be allowed to be tapped, and you can't find the place. Just remember that it should be the elevator near all the homestays that you'll pass by from the main lobby. And to take note that one of the bathrooms is located outside of the bedroom, not that it is a big trouble, but just for your info! <br/>Lastly, you might have to be the proactive one in contacting the host to ask for check-in details. Usually, we receive it 1-3 days before the check-in date, but in my experience, I have to contact the host on the day itself. (But they were very responsive thereafter) Other than that, we honestly, we enjoyed ourselves and loved the stay!"

It was about a 50-60k grab from the main city (10ish mins by car) which was fine by us as we didn‚Äôt want to be super close to busy areas - but that could be worth knowing if you like being closer in! Smartly and beautifully designed although some areas could do with a deeper clean."

We especially loved the common area, with its beautiful tiling and cozy vibe. The apartment is tucked away in a quiet alley, but it felt safe since it‚Äôs surrounded by local families.<br/>One interesting detail: the toilet and shower are in separate areas. The toilet is hidden behind what looks like a closet door. While the toilet is well ventilated, just a heads-up that if you‚Äôre doing a number two, some smell might drift into the room due to the small holes in the door. But don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthere‚Äôs another toilet right outside our room, so you can always use that to avoid<br/>Aside from that, everything was great. The host also shared a helpful list of local recommendations‚Äîwe had a lovely dinner at Chan, thanks to that! <br/>Would definitely recommend this place!"

Location helps you econom around 15 minutes by bike when you go outside hue attractions, compared to living in center. It's something special because of looking exactly like vietnamese family house from inside. We enjoyed the stay for sure.<br/>Photos should be updated, because second floor has a very cozy bedroom which isn't shown here. And probably due to season the entrance roof was covered with plants making it super dark from inside. First floor bedroom wasn't preferred due to feeling of moisture, but it was not a problem since it wasn't the only bedroom in the house."

Jedoch muss ich etwas Abzug in Bezug auf die Sauberkeit geben. Es schien uns so als w√§ren wir seit l√§ngerem die ersten G√§ste gewesen und daher waren einige Stellen (insbesondere Bad und Toilette) mit Spinnweben und toten Insekten besetzt. Insgesamt hat uns das nicht gro√üartig gest√∂rt und wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt. Die Betten waren sauber, frisch und bequem. Die Waschmaschine war ein gro√üer Pluspunkt. Gerne wieder!!"

The location is down at the very end of a tiny alleyway, making for a secluded, but not exactly private, setting.<br/> As the kitchen amenities listed only a pot for cooking, I asked the host prior to my arrival for extra equipment, and it was all provided... A very kind gesture on their part. Unfortunately, because of the layout and close proximity to the nearby buildings, the natural lighting is quite minimal. And because of the interior being somewhat damp, the space had a cavelike feeling. One more thing to note... The bathrooms are tiny, making showering difficult if you are a Westerner. But all in all I still enjoyed the layout, the chilled out environment, and my overall time here.<br/>As a solo traveler, the price is a bit high for what is provided. Yet, if you and a couple of friends decide to stay for a few days, then the price would make more sense."

I understand it is for security, I didn‚Äôt see one in the bedroom. <br/>There unfortunately is a ‚Äúsmell‚Äù in the house. It‚Äôs musty, not overwhelming but there is air-fresheners in every room to combat it. You get used to it the longer you‚Äôre in the house.

I slept really well. <br/>The hosts are exceptionally kind and generous. My time in Hue coincided with Tet, and was greatly enriched by staying at this family home. <br/>Since the listing is being updated, I won't comment on the amenities offered, except to say that if \"hot water\" is included, you'll know that the listing is current! <br/>Lastly, Google maps is off. The homestay CAN be reached from Thanh Hai street. <br/>Heading southwest and uphill, make a left after Doi Cafe. It's a minute walk downhill. No need to loop around."

Thu war sehr hilfreich und hat uns nett und freundlich empfangen. Da wir mit dem Wetter Pech hatte, war die kurze Distanz zur neuen Aeon Mall ein Segen. Dort l√§sst sich die Zeit gut vertreiben. Aber auch der Weg in die Altstadt von Hue ist in 5-10 Minuten geschafft. <br/>Die Hausregeln sollte man in der Anzeige ruhig nochmal erw√§hnen, da uns diese doch ein wenig streng vorkamen. Das Einhalten dieser ist aber f√ºr niemanden ein Problem."

We are big foodies, so she recommended a list of local places that represent the diversity of Hue cuisine- we loved the fact that we were the only tourists at most of these places.  The apartment looks exactly like the photos, stocked with everything you need in the kitchen.  Excellent aircon and circulation.  The check in process is great, as she personally shows you everything you need in person.  Grab is always a cheap way to head into the city, where all the action is. She also responds to messages really quickly.  Be sure to stay with Thu!"

          "comments": "Interaction was strange - when u arrived a whole family was moving out - as they were leaving they would give me strange looks - it was as if I had book the home of the whole family. Then when I tried to kindly explain I wasn‚Äôt comfortable and just was gonna cancel the owner aggressively made me go to the room upstairs and wait an hour till the family packed up their items - the whole time waiting dogs were barking outside , and I was really nervous to leave I finally left after an hour . When I was downstairs the owners room was next to kitchen, so it‚Äôs NOT THE WHOLE PROPERTY- something is lost in translationor thier intentions is to rent this a Home Stay or shared space and dont understand the difference-  Went to coffee shop did work booked a room in hotel - then came back told them I was going to airport as emergency. They were very kind I just think the whole situation of this family leaving for me to occupy the whole how was really off and didn‚Äôt sit well. Awkward - would recomed"

What really stood out was their genuine hospitality‚Äîwhen we needed to do laundry, the host showed up to assist us in person, which saved us so much time and hassle. The apartment is beautifully decorated and felt so cozy and welcoming. Our favorite part was the balcony, which is a lush, green haven full of plants. It's clear that the hosts are passionate about creating a sustainable and eco-friendly space, which we deeply admire. We couldn't have asked for a better stay. Highly, highly recommend!"

It also has a wash and dryer on the 5th floor so that was helpful because we had been traveling for a week, so we wanted to wash our clothes. Also, we asked for an extra towel and within a few minutes that was dropped off by the amazing woman who helps manage the Airbnb. There is on site assistance if you need anything or have any questions."

Unendlich viele Restaurants und Bars und Shops in der N√§he. Einfach super Lage. Wir waren drei N√§chte und w√§ren gerne noch geblieben. Vielen Dank! Top Empfehlung!"

The location was perfect - everything was easily accessible, with great places nearby to rent a motorbike and fun activities just around the corner.  <br/>Ben was an incredible host, always super quick to respond and incredibly helpful in making everything easy and seamless. His recommendations were fantastic and truly worth following.  <br/>We would come back anytime! Thank you so much for this wonderful stay."

Man sollte sich nur im klaren sein, dass die Unterkunft au√üerhalb des Stadtzentrums liegt und dass es in der direkten Umgebung nichts zu tun gibt. Daf√ºr hat die Unterkunft einen Pool und Fitnessraum und es gibt in der Wohnung eine Waschmaschine und einen Trockner mit Waschmittel, sodass diese kostenlos genutzt werden k√∂nnen. Das Stadtzentrum ist mit dem Taxi innerhalb von 10 min erreichbar. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt genossen und empfehlen die Unterkunft definitiv weiter!"

Whilst it's just outside the centre of Hue, we found it walkable and very easy and cheap to get a Grab car when needed. We able to walk to the Aeon shopping complex for supplies and it was a short cab ride back with our goods. Overall it was a wonderfully comfortable, clean space and have no hesitation recommending it to others."

Felt very comfortable and apartment is very clean. <br/>Great communication with hosts and they very generously allowed us to check out quite late to accomodate our train departure. Location was nice, about a 20 minute walk or so from some of the main city area but it‚Äôs always easy to get a car if you need to go further away."

They even rented a moped for us in advance upon request, which made getting around the city a breeze. The location is pretty unbeatable - residential and quiet, but mere blocks away from a main strip with lots of food options and convenience stores. The space itself was charming and had a lot of character, a classic Vietnamese style townhome. Having laundry was extremely helpful, and we were in want of nothing when it came to creature comforts. Will definitely be coming back to stay here again if I ever find myself back in Hu·∫ø, and would certainly recommend, especially for large groups."

The host is so kind and communicates so well. We felt right at home thanks to the helpful guidance and recommendations from the kind host.

Also a damp smell on arrival and cigarette smell in the master bedroom. Spacious place but could use updating and a fresh coat of paint. Also no comfortable seating area or sofa to hang out. To be fair we have been staying at places that cost more to compare to but the beds were an issue for quality of sleep."

There was a slight damp smell in this room however, nothing too bothersome. <br/>Other than that room, we were happy with our stay. There are lots of lovely restaurants and coffee shops in the local area and we were walking distance to the centre of Hue. <br/>The hosts allowed us to check in early too which was really helpful after a long travel day!"

It's a little bit grungy but that didn't make us feel uncomfortable.<br/>Remember to turn on and off the water heaters.<br/>My family had a great week long stay."

Check-in was easy and the host checked in often to ask about us.<br/>Host is very responsive and helpful. The place is very close to Hue landmarks! I rented a motorbike thanks to the host and was surprised to find out how close everything was. There‚Äôs also a mall nearby that the host recommended that I went to a few times. <br/>Highly recommend this place!"

Er hat uns viele tolle Tipps gegeben, war jederzeit erreichbar, hat f√ºr uns einen Roller organisiert und sogar Spielzeug f√ºr unsere Kinder bereitgelegt.<br/>Das Haus ist super gelegen, man kann zu Fu√ü viele Restaurants, einen lokalen Markt und Superm√§rkte erreichen. Hue ist toll.<br/>Abends ist es bis ca 22:30 Uhr etwas laut mit Musik, der Rest der Nacht ist aber ruhig.<br/>Leider hatten wir an den 3 letzten Tagen Pech, da gestartet wurde das Haus nebenan zu renovieren. Wir wurden jeden Morgen um 7 Uhr mit Baul√§rm geweckt. Daf√ºr kann aber der Host nat√ºrlich nichts.<br/>Das Haus hat 3 Stockwerke, das ausgeschriebene Kinderzimmer mit Schaukel befindet sich ganz oben. Dieses Zimmer hat unsere Erwartungen leider nicht getroffen, da es weder Licht noch Klimaanlage gab und sich unser Kids im eher kargen Raum nicht wohl gef√ºhlt haben.<br/>Der Rest des Hause hat uns gut gefallen."

The space itself was extremely clean and organised, and had all the listed amenities. The host was very responsive and friendly. The location was also perfect, since it was private and peacefully tucked away in an alley, but also walkable from the livelier parts of town. Check out was also straightforward, and hassle free. We had a very pleasant stay, and would be happy to stay here again in the future!"

Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Hue. Great location as well. 10/10 would stay again!"

It has everything you need - central location, newly renovated interior, squeaky clean, big table/work area, comfy bed, TONS of natural light, good wifi, and friendly helpful hosts.   I wish I could pack it up and take it with me for the rest of my travels, unpacking it at each new location, like a Central Asian nomad packing/unpacking his yurt in centuries gone by."

We were able to walk to several different areas that we wanted to explore, and we felt extremely comfortable in the space. We greatly appreciated the hosts, especially when my husband believed he left his wedding ring in the home after we checked out and they went above and beyond to try to help us. We highly recommend staying here!"

From the moment we arrived, everything was exactly as described‚Äîif not better. The space was spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, and thoughtfully stocked with all the essentials (and then some!). Love the bathtub and got to use it! üòÄ<br/>The host was incredibly responsive and welcoming, gave local tips(guidebook was provided) and making sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. Toiletries were there-from dental kit, shower cap, shaver, soap and shampoo.<br/>The location was ideal: quiet, safe, and within easy walking distance of great cafes, shops, and public transport. Whether you‚Äôre visiting for work or relaxation, this place is a perfect home base. Wifi was reliable and strong - about 100mbps- so my work was uninterrupted üôÉ.<br/>We would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-tier Airbnb experience.

One of my most memorable moments in Vietnam. Would definitely recommend."

We were so grateful. One thing that could have been nice to know before-hand was that 'sur' has a glass wall that faces towards the entrance - therefore it sadly isn't something for light-sleeper. One needs earplugs to sleep. Other than that, again, it was very lovely to stay at Limdim and everything is walkable and is located in a cute enviroment! I loved to be close to resident homes."

          "comments": "The stay at Limdim House was okay, but I wouldn‚Äôt stay there once more. <br/>The room looked more spacious on the pictures - but this wasn‚Äôt the problem. It was more that the bathroom was part of the room, so that the room itself was very humid. Opening the balcony door couldn‚Äôt help either, because it was shadowy all day long. <br/>Furthermore we didn‚Äôt quite feel as real guests - the host only showed us around once, then we never saw him again. There was no warm welcome, only a lot of rules to follow around the place. Every other question we had was answered with a reference to a PDF document he sent us upfront. <br/>The house itself is located in a calm neighbourhood, but the neighbours themselves were really loud during our stay: they did some drumming sounds in the middle of the night (around 12pm) and one can hear everything because the acoustics are quite good. <br/>Thank you anyway for letting us stay :)"

          "comments": "First the positives:<br/>1. Interesting design of the place and cool vibe <br/>2. Nice kitchen and washing facility <br/>3. Easy going host who didn‚Äôt mind our delayed train schedule <br/>4. Reasonable price <br/>Negatives:<br/>1. The house is in a very residential cul-de-sec with very very early neighbors who wake you up with their biz. Even the host family members are very early risers and you can hear them very well. <br/>And one of them rears roosters that do their rooster thing at 3am and 6/7am. <br/>It‚Äôs also not near anything particularly (no mini marts, cafes, etc) though a brisk 15 walks will get you to the walking street. <br/>2. Perhaps the host is not used to international guests and not sure how to receive foreign guests. He didn‚Äôt bother to explain the area or attractions around his house beyond one restaurant recommendation. <br/>His wifi password is also not shown anywhere and had to be prompted to reveal. <br/>When asked how the washing machine works, he pointed to the instruction sheet and said you can read that. <br/>The problem is it‚Äôs all in Vietnamese which clearly English speakers can‚Äôt understand.<br/>3. While the house design is cool and fun, some parts are not practical and/or doesn‚Äôt work.<br/>The toilet lights are next to the bed (not in the toilet) without any sign that it‚Äôs the toilet lights. Counter intuitive and very very confusing.<br/>The shower faucet fell off at first touch. <br/>AC system leaked for an hour at night when it started. <br/>The key card allows you access in and out of the house through its front gate. But since there is never anybody at check in/checkout counter aka kitchen, I had to open the gate with the key card, put my luggage to stop it from closing, run back to the house to put down key card and then run back down to leave. Doesn‚Äôt make sense. <br/>The room is also very small and hardly enough space for two to walk around the bed with our luggages. <br/>The bed squeaks loudly with any movement which meant waking up whenever your travel companion moves at all. <br/>Overall it looks nice in photos but the photos are kinda catfishy. The host might also wanna rethink his reception and check out procedures."

They were happy to store my luggage so I could explore the area and even let me check in early when possible. The property is slightly outside the city center, but the peaceful surroundings and easy transport more than make up for it. Every detail has been thoughtfully arranged: a pot of warm tea to welcome you, two bottles of iced tea in the fridge, and even complimentary instant noodles and coffee in the kitchen. The fully equipped kitchen and the huge dining area are ideal for group gatherings or cozy dinner parties."

You are welcomed with a pot of warm tea and two bottles of iced tea in the fridge. There are even free instant noodles and coffee in the kitchen. The well-equipped kitchen and dining room is huge, ready for any parties. The only room for improvement is the bed size. If you are traveling with your kids, do contact the host in advance for extra mattress as the bed is only for two people."

Last minute we booked this stay and asked to check in early after a big day of travel. With a bit less than an hours notice Hanh was able to have us settled into the house. We were given local tea and fresh bananas from the garden on entry. They made us feel very at home and settled after a lot of chaos."

This is a beautiful and spacious home. Large great room area to relax and enjoy the birds and nature outside while having meals and just hanging out. 3<br/>bedrooms upstairs 1 downstairs. 4 bathrooms total. Laundry facilities. Well stocked kitchen. Perfect situation for a group or just one or two travelers or vacationers.<br/>Motorbikes for rent are here and ready for you if needed. This place has multiple really cool coffee shops right around it. Food and market are a short walk away too. Have a great getaway without going to far away.<br/>10-15 min tops to any destination in Hu·∫ø you might want to see. Have the best of both worlds, nature and city life. The roof is a giant deck accessible by the outdoor circular stairs, go up and see the view. Explore the area too! It‚Äôs near lots of nature you can ride around in!"

She has a joyful disposition and genuinely wants to make your stay comfortable. She was so very kind to my wife and I. She regularly brought us eggs, food, and oranges for orange juice. She offered to make arrangements for us to rent a bike. She has a cleaning lady that comes regularly and keeps the room clean. The furnishing is modern. The bed is comfortable. The washer works great. The location is quiet and peaceful and within walking distance to some nice coffee shops and a gym on To Huu street. I honestly cannot say anything negative about my stay. I would highly recommend her place. 10/10."

The building has a lift(3 steps to the lift on the ground floor). The apartment and everything in it seems quite new: functioning kitchen, good shower, washing machine, refrigerator with a few bottles of water stocked, dining area, comfortable bed, lots of cupboard space. The place is super clean, no ants or mosquitoes. It has 2 small balconies with plenty of daylight as well as light blocking curtains. <br/>It's a 5 minute drive from Aeon mall, a mini-mart very nearby and some good vegetarian restaurants in the wider area. Highly recommend this place."

The location is convenient and quiet yet accessible to the main corridor of the city by grab or if you don‚Äôt mind a quick 20 minute walk. The home was just as described and the amenities were top-notch. I loved the thoughtful details and had everything I needed for a weeklong stay; loved all the storage space and though it was a studio apartment, it didn‚Äôt feel like it. Trang was also super responsive and helpful with local recommendations; she even helped me coordinate drop off of my personal item with a friend and had fresh fruit upon my arrival. She took the time to walk me through the apartment and made sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. I would definitely be back the next time I‚Äôm in Hue."

She was one of the kindest and most hospitable hosts we‚Äôve ever met, going above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. She helped us arrange a scooter rental effortlessly at a fair price. Her warmth and generosity really set this stay apart.<br/>The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed‚Äîwe especially loved having a kitchen area and the long table for meals and planning our days. The location is just slightly outside the main city, but only about 5 minutes by scooter‚Äîsuper easy to get around, and we actually preferred the quieter setting. Plus, there‚Äôs a fantastic coffee shop and b√°nh m√¨ spot right downstairs.<br/>If you‚Äôre visiting Hue, stay here. Trang is an incredible host, and you‚Äôll be well taken care of."

          "comments": "I really enjoyed myself at Trangs's place! <br/>It was a cozy, spacious and comfortable home in a lovely, quaint, European inspired neighbourhood. While you do need to call a Grab/taxi to get into town, it's a really short drive away. Honestly, I think I preferred this as being away from the main city area meant it was quiet and peaceful at all times of the day. I even enjoyed going on some walks with no issues at all.<br/>There's also some great cafes right next door and some really nice local restaurants just a few minutes walk away (across the little water crossing).<br/>The place was fully stocked with everything you need for laundry and cooking. Showers were hot but do note hot water does not last forever.<br/>Finally I'd like to mention that Trang herself was a great host. She met me personally to show me around, provided local restaurant and tourist recommendations, had great communication, and was just simply a kind person.<br/>I would definitely stay here again if ever back in Hue :)"

The room feels so homey and clean. Had enough utensils to cook for our breakfast. The room table is enough to work and to eat on. So far, one of the best airbnb we had been to. Highly recommended and definitely would go back if given a chance."

It is about a 12 minute car ride from the imperial citadel, we didn't visit the tombs due to lack of time but I imagine it is around the same. It is neither close nor far in terms of location! we recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet and peaceful place to stay at! The host was incredible kind and waited for us with an umbrella for check in, it was raining heavily that day and we arrived a bit late so she definitely went the extra mile. 100% recommend you book this place!"

The hostess welcomed us personally and gave us a lot of good tips on where to eat well, what places to visit, helped to sort out tickets for the onward journey. A place worth recommending and worth its price."

The room is as pictured, very clean and comfortable, as is the whole house. <br/>Any questions we had were answered right away üòä.<br/>The only negative was that the place is not the most sound proof and we were woken up early by loud noise outside.<br/>Overall we were very happy here.<br/>Thanks Huong!"

Super comfy.<br/>Great to have local recommendations and instructions to use the room well organised.<br/>Nice to have semy-private room<br/>It was a bit cold due to the weather and how open the house is.<br/>Overall recommend this place, had a great time there!"

We just had a few problems: the WiFi wasn‚Äôt very good, it kept dropping off, which isn‚Äôt great when you need to get some work done! The place was also quite dated (but despite this it was clean!). If you go to bed earlier than around 11/12pm then be aware there‚Äôs a club nearby and you can hear the music pretty loudly in the room. We also had an issue one night with other guests shouting and singing loudly late at night (probably after a night out) but we notified reception and they stopped pretty quickly. If none of these aspects bother you then I‚Äôd recommend booking this place üòä"

Wir konnten kostenlos in ein gr√∂√üeres Zimmer wechseln und die K√ºche sowie Pool benutzen. <br/>Die Lage ist etwas au√üerhalb und nachts etwas unheimlich. <br/>Wir waren sehr zufrieden!"
