Geräumiges Appartment, sehr bequemes Bett, gute Klimaanlage. 30 Sekunden zum See mit herrlicher Skyline. 2-10 Minuten zu hochwertigen Spas, Geschäften, Cafes und Restaurants. Mit Grab Bike für 1 Euro ins Old Quarter, zu Sky Lounges und Rooftop Bars etc. - ich habe es wirklich geliebt, war 6 Nächte da und konnte Hanoi richtig gut genießen. Ein echter Geheimtipp für Menschen, die es eher ruhig und friedlich mögen und auf Specials wie besondere Aussicht von Zimmer aus auch mal verzichten können."

L’hôte a été incroyablement accueillant et réactif, avec plein de bonnes recommandations locales. La climatisation fonctionnait parfaitement (indispensable à Hanoï !), et le lit était super confortable. Un vrai havre de paix après les journées bien remplies dans cette ville fascinante. Je recommande à 100 % et je reviendrai avec plaisir."

Rất dễ dàng tìm đc toà nhà vì nó nằm ở vị trí vô cùng đắc địa, ngay ngã tư đường và nhìn thẳng ra hồ tây. Dù muộn nhưng lễ tân vẫn rất niềm nở và tôi có thể nhận phòng nhanh chóng và dễ dàng. Xung quanh có rất nhiều quán ăn, cafe và chỉ cách hồ tây 20m, cách lotte 3p đi bộ, giao thông xung quanh vô cùng thuận tiện. Căn hộ nhỏ xinh, sạch sẽ, thoáng mát và đầy đủ tiện nghi.  Tôi nhận phòng vào buổi đêm nên chưa thấy đc tầm nhìn của căn hộ ngay lúc nhận phòng, sáng ra tôi vô dùng bất ngờ với view của căn hộ này. Ban công đc thiết kế bàn ghế vô cùng xinh xắn và view đc cả hồ tây và sông. Ngồi uống cafe buổi sáng gió mát và rất chill. Căn hộ phù hợp nếu đi 1-2 ng. Chủ nhà luôn sẵn sàng hỗ trợ và trả lời rất nhanh kể cả là buổi đêm. Giá phòng rất phù hợp và chất lượng thì trên cả tuyệt vời. Tôi chắc chắn sẽ trở lại và giới thiệu cho bạn bè"

Bright and comfortable, great views of the cityscape, very accessible. We loved our stay and hope to be back. Quyen made our stay fantastic."

The location is unbeatable -  just a minute away from West Lake, which made for peaceful mornings and lovely evening walks.<br/>The sunrise from the balcony is also extremely beautiful, and we loved having our coffee with that view. <br/>The studio itself was clean, well-furnished, and exactly as described. It had everything I needed for a comfortable stay, including strong Wi-Fi, a comfy bed, and great air conditioning - much appreciated in the summer heat. The large window with a view of the lake was definitely a highlight!<br/>Quyen was a thoughtful and responsive host, always quick to answer any questions and make sure everything went smoothly.<br/>Would highly recommend this place for solo travelers or couples looking for a relaxing, scenic stay in Hanoi."

The location is fantastic, tucked away in a quiet street so I always had a peaceful sleep, which I really appreciated. The space is cozy, well-designed, and has everything you’d need for a comfortable stay, even a lovely little perfume shop which was a nice touch.<br/>The only thing I wish it had was a washer and dryer, especially for longer stays (a week or more). Being able to do laundry on-site would make the place absolutely perfect. I hope Ken considers adding that in the future.<br/>Overall, I had such a pleasant experience and would definitely stay again the next time I’m in Hanoi. Highly recommend!"

The instructions to check in weren’t very clear - we told the Air BnB we’d be arriving very late - which meant when we arrived we found the shutters were down. Would have been good to have known this before as we were unsure if you needed a key to remove the shutters. Little expensive for the state of the property too but overall OK."

They offered free laundry service which was a great bonus :). The only thing that was a little less than ideal was shower temperature as it was either too hot or not hot enough - but that wasn’t too much of an issue and I would definitely recommend. Also the entry is at a flower shop which I found to be charming with a nice fragrance inviting you into your trip."

The service and communication were spot-on, just like always. The apartment was sparkling clean, cozy, and felt like a home away from home. The location is fantastic—super close to the Old Quarter and just a short walk to train street. Highly recommend to everyone!"

Die Waschmaschine war ein großes Plus, besonders für längere Aufenthalte. Sie war einfach zu bedienen und es war super praktisch, während der Reise Kleidung waschen zu können.<br/>Die Lage ist perfekt – mitten im Herzen von Hanoi, nur wenige Gehminuten von der Altstadt, der Train Street und vielen lokalen Highlights entfernt. Trotz der zentralen Lage war die Wohnung ruhig und bot einen erholsamen Rückzugsort nach einem langen Tag voller Erkundungen.<br/>Omai ist eine außergewöhnliche Gastgeberin. Die Kommunikation war schnell und klar, und an jedes Detail wurde gedacht. Ich fühlte mich während meines gesamten Aufenthalts wirklich gut umsorgt 🙂"

It’s also very aesthetic, nicely decorated and visually pleasant. The room felt super cozy, just like being in my own bedroom.<br/>The amenities were complete, including a small kitchen where I could prepare instant meals when I was hungry or didn’t feel like going out. The host was also very helpful and responsive, which made the stay even more enjoyable.<br/>I highly recommend this place, especially for solo travelers or those traveling with friends. Thank you for the warm and lovely stay!"

The place was clean and tidy and we even got a free clean during our stay. We personally spent more time in central Hanoi and the old quarter so we had to get grabs most days but other than that the location was good and so was our overall stay. Would definitely recommend to others :)"

          "comments": "Я заселилась немного раньше времени, поэтому уборщица не успела убрать жилье, но ничего страшного, потому что как мы связались с владельцем, он тут же ответил и приехала уборщица и все убрала. Были несколько вопросов по поводу жилья, но когда нам нужна была помощь, то владелец очень быстро отвечал. Жилье находится 7-10 минутах езды от центра города, нужно лишь пересечь мост. Вначале я немного беспокоилась о том что дома нет стиральной машины, но буквально в 10 минутах ходьбы рядом расположено химчистка, поэтому можно не переживать о грязной одежде. Рядом есть платная парковка, где можно оставить арендованный мопед. Единственный минус это освещение в туалете, если кто-то красится, то довольно сложно будет сделать хороший макияж, так как освещение желтое и не предает все недостатки, а в целом хорошее жилье для недолгого проживания."

I think every host should do that. <br/>The place itself is so well kept, comfy and feels like home. If you're working remotely (like me) the wifi is reliable and super fast.

Love the face there is a dedicated space to keep your luggage and a sofato rest in case you reach early or want to explore the city after check out and don't need to carry it around. There is also a washing machine and dryer available to use which came in very handy for us. Having Netflix is a great touch to relax at the room after a long day of exploring Hanoi.  Overall great experience!"

Felt safe and secure,  had filtered water available and there are some really good food places nearby. Fully reccomend and would definitely stay again, thanks!"

Dat was erg handig, want we kwamen laat op de avond aan. Toen we aankwamen waren we aangenaam verrast. Huong had voor ons de kamer klaargemaakt. Alles was heel proper en netjes. Het appartement was erg rustig gelegen. Op 20 minuuutjes wandelen stonden we in Old Quarter. Dankjewel voor het aangename verblijf!"

The instructions to reach the place were super clear, and it was very easy to find. Ms. Huong and the host was amazing - so responsive even before check-in and throughout my stay. She helped with everything, from an early check-in to connecting me with a great local for bike rentals. The space itself was exactly as described, and I really felt at ease here. They were also kind enough to be flexible with my checkout. Total recommendation if you want a smooth, peaceful stay that's still well-connected to the city"

The apartment is very homey- we were impressed with the intelligent way the interior design was done. It has a loft for extra people and a good table for working (we had to work remotely full time during our stay). The shower is great and the bathroom corner is cleverly integrated in the apartment. They also had a washing machine :) I recommend this place and will definitely try to return !"

The room was super clean, well-designed and had lovely little details that made it feel like home. I especially appreciated how much natural light it had. The host was incredibly welcoming and helpful with great local tips, which made exploring the city so easy. If you want a comfortable, charming stay in the heart of Hanoi, I highly recommend this place."

Жилье подойдет тем, кто хочет окунуться в местную жизнь и прочувствовать вьетнамский колорит. Удобные кровати, стиральная машинка и кухня. Хозяин был всегда на связи и дал очень четкие инструкции по заселению"

You’re just steps away from amazing street food, cafes, and all the energy of the city, yet the apartment itself is calm, clean, and incredibly comfortable.<br/>What really made the experience special was the warm hospitality of the couple who run the place. They were so kind, thoughtful, and genuinely caring—always ready to help with tips, recommendations, or just a friendly chat. You can feel that they put their heart into every detail.<br/>If you want to experience the soul of Hanoi while having a quiet, cozy retreat to come back to, this is the place. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat."

L’appartement de Dzung et Thy est parfait : il est en plein cœur d’Hanoi mais permet tout de même un séjour calme et paisible, au milieu de l’effervescence de la ville. Il est également propre et soigné, de bon goût et très bien agencé : on s’y sent vraiment comme chez soi ! <br/>Malgré tous ces points déjà forts positifs, le point fort du séjour a été la gentillesse de Dzung et Thy, qui sont là pour vous à chaque étape du séjour, de l’arrivée au départ. Nous avons même eu la chance de boire un café avec eux, nous permettant d’échanger et de mettre un visage sur cette gentillesse ! Ils n’hésiteront d’ailleurs pas à vous donner tous leurs conseils et recommandations pour le reste de votre voyage au Vietnam, ce qui est très précieux ☺️<br/>Une merveilleuse expérience, j’espère avoir la chance de revenir chez eux un jour <br/>N’hésitez pas : si vous passez par Hanoï, c’est ici que vous devez séjourner ! Merci pour tout :)"

We walked to many of the attractions in Hanoi. There is a street market within a few minutes walk. We could buy tofu, vegetables and fruits.<br/>The house is spacious. We were happy to have separate living and sleeping spaces. We used the kitchen to make meals. The television is large and good quality. The bathroom has two fans and the water heated very quickly. We had plenty of towels. The air conditioning was effective and kept us cool.<br/>This was a great place to stay in Hanoi. Highly recommended if you like peace and quiet!"

Direkt nebenan gibt es ein supergutes kleines Restaurant mit einer fantastischen Reisnudelbowl \"Bun bo nam bo\" und gutem Cappuccino! Wir haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen und denken dass das Apartment für 2 Personen sehr comfortabel ist, aber für ein paar Nächte auch zu viert funktioniert. Es war die ruhigste Straße die wir in 2 Wochen Hanoi erlebt haben... 😊"

(Prison, Train Street, lots of restaurants) There was some construction noise in the morning but the host warned us about that, and it wasn't a big deal because we got up early anyways. There is a market on the street and they also have the outdoor workout equipment right outside the apartment which we made use of. I feel like the kitchen and bathroom areas could use a better clean. The hosts were very responsive and friendly and my boyfriend had fun feeding the fish haha."

Im Apartment war ein undefinierbarer Geruch der störte. Außerdem ist das Bett sehr durchgelegen und fällt in die Mitte ein und ist deshalb nicht bequem. Die Dusche ist sehr unpraktisch verbaut, sodass das<br/> gesamte Bad (Waschbecken, Toilette) nass wird und der Abfluss war verstopft. Das Interior ist veraltet und die Wände weisen Flecken auf. Wir können die Unterkunft leider nicht weiterempfehlen."

Dù phải leo mấy tầng cao (may mà có anh đẹp trai tốt bụng giúp bê hành lý), nhưng căn phòng hoàn toàn xứng đáng. Siêu sạch sẽ, cảm giác mới tinh như vừa khai trương. View nhìn thẳng ra đường tàu, đúng chuẩn “đỉnh của chóp”, ngồi trong phòng vẫn có thể chill và ngắm nhìn Hà Nội theo một cách rất riêng. Xung quanh thì khỏi nói, quán xá nhiều vô kể, từ cà phê đến đồ ăn địa phương đều đủ cả. Một trải nghiệm Airbnb không thể nào quên!"

Downside are the stairs (LOL) since my room is at the 4th floor and its kind of a struggle when the weather is HOT and the frequent power interruption at night (literally just 2 seconds) but maybe not their fault since they explained it was due to the hot weather and the hanoi power system getting overloaded.<br/>My stay here is superb because of LAN. She’s sooo kind and caring like a mother. She greets you with a smile and happily helps you on whatever you need.

Alles war super sauber und besonders Lan, die uns am Anfang wahnsinnig herzlich begrüßt hat, hat unseren Aufenthalt versüßt! Sie hat immer super schnell auf unsere Nachrichten geantwortet,  hat sogar ein Restaurant für uns reserviert und uns, als es geregnet hat, einen Regenschirm hingestellt. Sehr aufmerksam und umsichtig :) Vielen Dank, wir können diese Unterkunft sehr weiterempfehlen! Auch wegen der super Lage."

It's within walking distance to many of Hanoi's top attractions and has every type of food, clothing, electronic, and service/product offering imaginable.<br/>Lan the housekeeper should have her name engraved over the door, this place wouldn't run half as well without her. The owners were very prompt and helpful with recommendations, local info, help with SIM, transport, and anything else you can think of as well.<br/>If I could give it 10 stars I would, but 5 would be for Lan"

The view is stunning, with the sunrise right in front of your window. Bed is large and comfortable, brilliant white towels are changed every day, there’s always a water, the air conditioner is new and well maintained. It’s all I needed — on top of that an amazing surprise, a laundry service which was very helpful on this trip. Cleaning lady is taking care of you with a lot of intention and the host checked in with me multiple times if I feel comfortable. The building is in front of train railway so it is noisy — you’re provided the earplugs and eye mask. My sleep is deep, so I personally had no problem, but you must be aware of this fact.  Plus — Lots of stylish and interesting coffee shops around. Thank you for everything!"

It’s a 15min drive to Old Quarter on bike. And there’s a few convenient stores within walking distance. No complains! Would def stay here again~"

Brian was super helpful and thoughtful throughout our stay. They were always quick to respond to any questions and even provided earplugs due to some construction going on outside. While we ended up sleeping just fine without them, it was a kind and considerate gesture that made us feel very cared for. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a smooth, stress-free stay!"

It looks exactly as pictured and described, we were satisfied with the overall cleanliness also. The host even messaged beforehand to inform us of construction in the building next door and provided ear plugs, however although the next door building was a construction site, construction was not active during our stay - so we had no noise complaints!<br/>Only thing to be mindful of is there are a few flights of stairs to go up to access the apartment (and no elevators), which may make it difficult for some people to carry luggage up. But I would definitely recommend!"

We also enjoyed the location, as it’s walking distance from the old part of the city, but it feels a bit calmer. If you struggle with sleeping, bring ear plugs, as it can be a bit noisy at night."

We arrived before check in, so they had warmly allowed us to leave our luggage while we went to explore. It was just next to the train street, but once you got to the room you just shut out all the noise. There was a projector in the room and a bathtub, 2 things that are not common so that was really enjoyable for us. Bed was really comfortable too, and they had filtered water in the room so you could really stay all day in here. Definitely recommend this stay."

The host went above and beyond—when my baggage was lost at the airport, Mr. Toan immediately stepped in to help, offering support and guidance despite the late hour. Communication was excellent from start to finish, and he even arranged a taxi from the airport for me, making everything as smooth and stress-free as possible given the circumstances. Truly outstanding hospitality. If you're considering booking—don’t hesitate! This place (and the host) is top-notch."

An amazing, stylish, quirky little apartment.<br/>Very clean, good location in Old quarter. It’s a busy road but you can’t hear much noise at all. Very lovely cafe at the bottom with delicious egg coffee.  The only thing we’d suggest is more storage space for large travel rucksacks but no big issue at all."

I was even so exhausted and left my purse in the drivers car the host responded immediately and got my purse back to me with in 10 minutes.

It’s also exactly my vibe with the art, decorations, lighting. It’s very clean. I would recommend anyone to stay in here if they want a little oasis in Hanoi. <br/>The only thing abt Long Bien is that it’s a drive away from Old Quarter. Which I didn’t mind doing as Grab Bikes are easy and it only takes 10 mins crossing the bridge.<br/>I am considering staying next time maybe for one month in Hanoi and I will definitely book her AirBnbs if I do so."

Finding the apartment was a little tricky but getting into the building and room were safe and secure. The room had plenty of dishes, pots, pans, and utensils to use. The bathroom was big and clean. The bed and bedroom were comfy and had plenty of space. The only thing was that my room was on the side of the building that didn’t have windows with sunlight and that made the room very dark all the time. I wish I knew which room I had so I could pick the one with more sunlight. On the bright side (haha), it was nice and dark to sleep in when I wanted. Overall, a great few days stay."

It’s also conveniently located near the city center, making it easy to get around. Just one small thing — the painting of a man in the bathroom made me feel a bit uneasy, especially when staying alone. Everything was fine, but it did give me a slight chill during showers. I hope this can be taken into consideration. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely come back!"

Felt like the home I'd like to have :) And as a bonus, staying in the rabbit warren of alleyways behind street shopfronts was fascinating. The room? A delight to step into and exactly like the photos. Excellent air conditioner which was important to me due to the intense heat in Hà Nội right now. And what a funky shower. Been travelling for nearly 90 days yet this is the first time I've seen a shower quite like the shower in this place. Works wonderfully well. Highly recommend."

No major issues and problems whatsoever. <br/>The only issue was and to be honest it’s really not that big of a deal but if you want to explore old quarter and for myself I ended up going there most days - it’s a drive away which makes it annoying. There isn’t much to do around the place either however it is a place to sleep and a good one for that."

The staff were also lovely, always friendly, polite, and helpful whenever I had a question.<br/>The neighborhood is great, very close to the city center, so there’s always something to do nearby. But at night, it becomes peaceful and quiet, and I felt completely safe walking around. It was the perfect balance between convenience and comfort. I’d definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting!"

The place is tucked right above a Laundry shop, so I almost missed it at first, but the host was already waiting and came out to greet me as soon as I reached out. She was incredibly welcoming and took time to walk me through everything in the room. The space itself is a bit smaller than I thought, but it’s really clean, well-organized, and the balcony has a charming view of the street. The neighborhood is lively and walkable with plenty of local spots to explore. Would absolutely recommend!"

She is highly communicative and always answered within ten minutes, accommodating about switching rooms, helping me with laundry. It's near enough to the city activities without being on a main road. Please note the building is stairs only, and I found lower floors has too much noise from the street but upper floors are more quiet. I will stay here again! ⭐"

I loved the apartment! - it's furnished and decorated in a beautiful manner, to be honest, I truly imagine myself living in it for life! (and I loved the balcony)! Apart from the looks, it has everything you need. The only way it could be improved would be the availability of a water purifier (or at least a bottle of water in the fridge), but apart from that it was almost perfect and I highly recommend! It's beautiful :)"

Even before booking, the host was incredibly helpful, they sent over a detailed video tour and additional photos since the unit was newly listed, which really helped me feel confident about my decision. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures! Bright, stylish, and thoughtfully designed.<br/>The host was also very accommodating and responsive, providing extra items I requested like a clothes iron and cleaning supplies. Everything was ready and set up upon arrival. The cleaning staff were also very friendly.<br/>The space itself was perfect for working remotely, with good natural light, a comfortable workspace, and beautiful views of the lake, especially at sunset. I highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a quiet, cozy, and elegant place to stay in Hanoi. Would definitely come back!"

The natural light, chic decor, and calming ambiance make it the perfect space to unwind or create. Every detail is thoughtfully curated, giving it main character energy in the best way. Special mention on Ms. Vivian such an amazing host!!! However the washroom could use a little renovation and if you are a light sleeper, the lively streets can be a challenge. But the overall vibe is still amazing, would stay again! 💖🏡"

Die Gastgeber waren super freundlich, proaktiv, jederzeit erreichbar und haben mir auch hilfreiche Tipps gegeben. Die Unterkunft liegt in der Nähe von einem See und die direkte Umgebung ist lebendig, doch im Vergleich zum Rest von HaNoi eher ruhig, da es weniger Straßenverkehr gab, was sehr angenehm war. Das Zentrum war von der Unterkunft aus zu Fuß erreichbar. Klare Empfehlung!"

Man kommt prima zu Fuß in die Altstadt und zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten. Das einzige was man wissen sollte ist, dass es abends sehr laut auf der Straße ist und man im Zimmer alles mitbekommt (besonders am Wochenende). Uns hat das aber nicht gestört :)"

Located at the eastern tip of West Lake. Close by to alot of the monuments, ie the pagoda, imperial citadel and mausoleum to name a few.<br/>Entrance is next to the back of a restaurant so it is a little bit dirty but the apartment itself is clean. When you're inside the apartment you will constantly get a whiff of food being prepared in the kitchen next door.<br/>Place is noisy even during late night on weekdays(plenty of dog barking). No curtain for the windows to fully block the sunlight and no shower curtain in the toilet so floor might get a bit slippery.<br/>Vivian herself is polite and helpful. Fast to reply and accommodating.<br/>All in all, I believe it is more than worth the price. Thank you for having me, Vivian."

Sebbene le dimensioni siano contenute, l’appartamento è perfettamente organizzato e dispone di tutto il necessario per un soggiorno confortevole. La posizione è ideale, a soli 30 minuti a piedi dal centro, in una zona tranquilla e silenziosa, perfetta per rilassarsi dopo una giornata di esplorazione. Inoltre, l'host è stato molto gentile e disponibile, sempre pronto a darci consigli e a risolvere qualsiasi richiesta. Un'ottima esperienza che consiglio vivamente a chi cerca un luogo tranquillo e ben posizionato per visitare la città!"

We were greeted by Hoa and her service given is above and beyond, she offered to do our laundry for our convenience and was surprised it’s free of charge.

Will surely recommend the place to friends and family."

Cứ nghĩ homestay thì xoàng lắm nhưng sau những gì mình đã trải nghiệm thì chắc phải thay đổi khái niệm đó từ đây . Phòng sạch sẽ, được trang trí decor tinh tế mang tính nghệ thuật cao . Có đầy đủ tiện nghi như máy lạnh, nước nóng, wifi tốc độ cao vì đều là đồ mới các bạn ạ . Vị trí rất thuận tiện cho việc di chuyển tới những khu vực vui chơi giải trí như ( đào duy từ - tạ hiện - chợ đêm đồng xuân..v...v  và các điểm tham quan nổi tiếng gần khu vực trung tâm . Và đặc biệt nhất là có 2 bạn gái là quản lý Homestay này là bạn Linh & My các bạn vừa xinh xắn , tốt bụng và dịch vụ cskh tốt . Xin cảm ơn hai bạn nhiều và hẹn gặp lại vào một dip gần nhất nhé 😍"

It’s tucked away from the noise but still close enough to walk to everything. Perfect spot to recharge.<br/>The host was incredibly kind and thoughtful. It didn’t feel like just a place to crash — more like staying at a friend’s house who actually cares if you’re having a good time. They gave great local tips and made sure I had everything I needed, which I really appreciated.<br/>It’s one of those places that quietly makes your trip better without trying too hard. I left feeling rested, grateful, and already planning to come back next time I’m in Hanoi."

I wish I could have stayed longer, but unfortunately there were no more rooms available. Next time I’m in Hanoi, I will definitely return to this place. <br/>The location is perfect: quiet, bright, well-connected, with great cafés and restaurants nearby… and beautiful views of lakes and green spaces. The room was tastefully decorated, clean, and had a lovely fresh scent. <br/>They told me they had just opened and were very attentive to every detail, which I truly appreciated. Plus, there’s an adorable and friendly little cat wandering around:) . I wish them all the best with their Guest House and I look forward to returning."

The sweet old lady that does the cleaning and lives on premises is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. She gave me a hug and made me feel at home. I was only there for a night and wanted to extend my stay but they were booked up. After checkout, they helped me use the WiFi and held my bags for me while I figured out my next moves. Host and all team members were very nice and helpful. While the room is not exactly as pictured on the listing, it's cozy and the A/C & heater works really well. I like my room to be on the warmer side and it delivered on the cooler, rainy Hanoi nights. Overall a very good stay."

The place is beautiful with stunning views from the bedroom. <br/>Amazing rooftop view at night and a huge pool (60k per use)<br/>I wasnt able to use the gym unfortunately as they dont do weekly passes, only monthly, which was a shame but cant be helped. <br/>There are loads of shops, restaurants and cafes around the complex and the area is super peaceful - a world away from the insane business of Hanoi and a welcome repreive! Beautiful walks and all in all an excellent stay. 1000% recommend."

The apartment building is mostly rooms from this host, so which room you get is probably random (floor and size). There is a free to use laundry machine in the roof top of the building which is nice. Wi-fi is pretty good to work from the room if you have to like I did and there's a smart TV you can connect to if you want to watch something."

The building is very secure, didn't feel unsafe at all. <br/>Location - I loved the location, I was amongst where the locals live, not the tourists. The studio flat is over an hour walk from Hanoi Old Quarter, Taxi/Bike is 15/20minutes. <br/>Building - Please note this is a new building, there is currently work going on -  until completed, you will hear banging. <br/>Washing Machine - is located on the 7th floor, I messaged the owner as I didn't know where it was at the time (no details on AirBnB profile) the owner got back to me over 24hours later late at night, I was leaving the following morning. <br/>Please note you will need to buy your on washing machine detergent etc. <br/>Studio Room - Was perfect, nice clean bathroom, shower was lovely, comfortable bed, air con was a blessing and having a fridge to put my water in, couldn't go wrong. <br/>Overall, I highly reccomend."

While it’s not super close to Hoan Kiem Lake or the internet-famous cafes like Giang, the location is still good—peaceful and quiet.  <br/>Check-in was very convenient, even with our late-night arrival. The place was spotless, the aircon was nice and cold, and the pillows and towels were all set—super comfy! Plus, the staff at the spa were really nice, which added to the experience.  <br/>We also loved the thoughtful touch of having a garment steamer and a hairdryer in the room—it felt more like a hotel than just an Airbnb!  <br/>The host was very responsive and accommodating. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend it!"

It sort of felt like doing an escape room, but in a secure way.  <br/>The elevator is a nice touch for this space. <br/>The bathroom shower is wet room style, so expect to squeegee the floor once you finish showering.  <br/>I rented a scooter during my stay and the hosts had secure parking available.  <br/>The area is nice with restaurants and services in walking distance.  Decent location.  Old Quarter is still 18 minutes walk or short taxi ride. <br/>The view out the window is the neighboring building.  The bed is comfortable.  WiFi works fine.  The kitchen had one hot plate burner, but that was good for our needs.  <br/>After hours check out was also easily managed.  <br/>Overall, a nice stay.  Thanks so much!"

Alles war sauber und der Check-In war super flexibel. <br/>Leider mussten wir unseren Aufenthalt verkürzen, da gegenüber eine Großbaustelle im vollen Gange war, bei der selbst am Sonntag die komplette Nacht durchgearbeitet wurde. Das fanden wir sehr schade, da wir wirklich gerne länger in der Unterkunft geblieben wären. Die Kommunikation mit Quynh war aber wirklich super! Sie hat uns sofort Hilfe angeboten, da der Baulärm wohl nicht üblich ist. Sie hat sich um eine neue Unterkunft gekümmert und wollte sogar unser Taxi zu der Unterkunft übernehmen. Außerdem hat Sie nun direkt in der Anzeige ergänzt, dass aktuelle Lärm von der Baustelle gegenüber entstehen kann. Aus diesen Gründen geben wir der Unterkunft trotzdem 5 Sterne!"

The accommodation has everything you may need for a long stay and it is very clean, cozy and nicely decorated. The surrounding area feels safe and well-maintained, with lots of shops, cafes, restaurants and places to have a walk.<br/>Quỳnh Anh is a truly wonderful host and was very helpful. She proactively provided an extra blanket when it got colder and treated me to some delicious homemade food before the New Year. And when I accidentally locked myself out of the apartment she was able to resolve it very quickly. :) <br/>Thank you for a great stay and I hope to be back again one day!"

The apartment itself was clean, beautifully decorated, and fully equipped with everything I needed, from a comfy bed and modern bathroom and fast Wi-Fi. The host was very welcoming and responsive, offering great recommendations for local food and attractions. This place really felt like a peaceful retreat right in the heart of Hanoi. Highly recommended for both short and long stays!"

There’s a mini mart, pharmacy, and coffee shop right downstairs, which was super convenient. A washing machine is also available on the first floor.<br/>My very first impression was how fresh and pleasantly scented the room always was. What impressed me the most was how kind and responsive the host was. They even replied to my messages at 1 AM to help me order food. I truly appreciated their warm hospitality. We had a wonderful and relaxing stay here, and I would definitely recommend this place to others."

The location is unbeatable — right in the Old Quarter and just a short walk to Hoan Kiem Lake. The area is full of life, with so many famous and delicious traditional food spots around every corner. It was exactly the atmosphere I had missed.<br/>The apartment was clean, stylish, and very comfortable. Even though it’s in the center of everything, it was surprisingly quiet at night, which I really appreciated after a long day out. The host was welcoming, responsive, and made sure I had everything I needed.<br/>And honestly, for such a prime location, the price was more than reasonable. It’s rare to find a place that combines great location, comfort, and value so well.<br/>Highly recommend this place if you want to experience the real Hanoi!"

Das Frühstück war okay. Essen im \"Restaurant\" auch. Wenn man etwas Fußweg auf sich nimmt könnte man auch im Ort essen. Viel los ist dort aber nicht.

The food was delicious and the Home Stay is beautifully located in peaceful nature at a river a little outside of Ha Giang. They were very fast answering questions live or digitally and helped to organize stuff for me. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks for your family’s hospitality!"

The hot water shower helped shake some stress off. The host helped arrange a tour in no time and also coordinated with my bus driver so that I would have a taxi available to get to the AirBnB at 3 am, he even coordinated at that time with the bus driver although arrangements had been made at 7 pm in the evening! Much appreciated!"

The food was lip smacking and hearty made by An’s mother. We had booked a hike with them and they were so fun! We went to a serene valley spot for hiking and swimming. It was the most mesmerising experience!! <br/>An and her family are incredible people with such warmth and love. We left with our hearts and tummies full! An also gifted a with the cutest souvenir! Very grateful for that. <br/>Would strongly recommend An’s house for a comfy and memorable stay!"

Probably the best we got in Vietnam!<br/>She took care of everything for us, from the bus to get to Ha Giang (that we almost missed due to a wrong departure indication, but that we finally got thanks to her as she called a driver to take us and bring us to the bus which was already on the road. Unbelievable how reactive she’s been!), to the Ha Giang loop we did in 3 days, to the final bus from Ha Giang to Ninh Binh. I’ve never seen a host as kind and professionnel as her. We know we could be 100% safe with her. <br/>The place is magical, surrounded by rice Fields and nature. Ecolodge style.<br/>Ha Giang loop is definitely a tour you should do with An as her drivers and guides are local and know exactly how to avoir big groups so that you have an intimacy feeling. They are also very kind and excellent drivers.<br/>Huge thanks Lady An’s again and the whe team!"

Que dire… ce fut une soirée et une nuit exceptionnelle. <br/>Nous avons pu dîner avec A Li et sa femme, le repas était très bon et nous avons échanger avec eux ( via un traducteur mais l’essentiel est de se faire comprendre ).<br/>La tente possède tout le confort nécessaire et surtout la vue est a coupé le souffle.<br/>La salle de bain et les toilettes sont très propres.<br/>Une de mes meilleurs expérience sur Airbnb et autre… <br/>Merci encore à A Li."

Mit großem Abstand das beste und besonderste Airbnb in dem ich je untergekommen bin. Neben der unfassbar schönen Aussicht bekommt man zudem einen Einblick in die regionale Küche und Kultur. Das gemeinsame Abendessen mit den beiden Gastgebern war so herzlich schön und lecker, dass allein diese Erfahrung es wert gewesen wäre dort hinzukommen. Ich gebe gern gute Bewertungen ab, aber so gerechtfertigt wie diese hier war wirklich noch keine. Eine ingesamt fantastische Erfahrung, die wir nie vergessen werden. cảm ơn!"

We had initial trouble finding homestay as it is located in the back of the driveway and host didn't communicate instructions, but we were able to locate and get in contact after a bit. Regardless, Dung and his family treated us well and offered dinner and breakfast. Breakfast in their kitchen was delicious. The house itself is beautiful with great views and everything you need. We would recommend to anybody visiting Ha Giang!"

We felt very comfortable in the space and hope to be back sometime. <br/>Dung is a great host. From before our arrival in Ha Giang he got in contact with our bus driver to find out where we were arriving at and organised a taxi to pick us up. He also gave us some great tips regarding completing the loop, and was happy to sit down with us to discuss helpful details. <br/>Although the airbnb is slightly outside of the centre, Dung was so kind as to allow us to borrow one of his motorbikes before we managed to hire our own. <br/>The host and the space are great, and I thoroughly recommend it :)"

Hosts and contractors worked continuously on the guest houses while I was completing my visit in the shared space and I was lucky to see both the artistic vision come to fruition, and to extend my stay to experience the finished product.<br/>The strikingly modern addition within the powerfully authentic setting is a beautiful duality that must be experienced.  The brand new technological amenities were luxurious and helpful.  The family hospitality, cooking, and conversation were absolutely wonderful and contributing to what will be lifelong memories.<br/>The town is quaint yet vibrant with a fun night life.  The location is stunning, and centrally located for exploring the northern end of the Ha Giang province.  I can't recommend this lovely homestay enough for the beauty, hospitality, and delicious delicious meals."

We hebben hier ook onze scooters gehuurd, die van hele goeie kwaliteit waren. We hebben de Loop zelf gereden, maar we konden altijd whatsappen als we tips nodig hadden. Ze hebben ook voor ons de nachtbus naar Cat Ba geregeld, die ons bij het hostel ophaalde. Zo konden we na afloop van de loop meteen door! De Ha Giang Loop is prachtig om te rijden, het mooiste van onze reis door Vietnam! En ik raad dit hostel zeker aan als begin- en eindpunt. Veel plezier!"

I must say that the pictures look a little better than what the rooms really are. The room on 2nd floor was in better shape than 3rd floor which had an AC that was rattling too loud to sleep with (luckily there was a fan). <br/>But apart from that everything was clean, there was hot water and towels. Breakfast was also included (i preferred the eggs over the overly sweet banana pancakes)<br/>Considering the great service and hospitality, I would always come back. Thank you guys so much!"

Die Zimmer sind sehr groß. Die Matratzen sind relativ hat also wenn man das nicht mag sollte man das beachten. ansonsten war die Unterkunft ausreichend für unsere Bedürfnisse. Dung war sehr freundlich und hat immer schnell geantwortet wir konnten freundlicherweise auch schon vor den Check in in die Unterkunft."

Perfectly walkable to some other restaurants and such, but it also has a cafe built into it for your coffee needs :)"

The food available for purchase on-site was out of this world and intimate.  The location is of course stunning and nicely situated for exploring further north.  The town is cozy yet vibrant with plenty to do.  Karaoke and other merriment blasted into the mountains gives an unexpected music festival vibe at brief  times.  A magical and timeless experience, with this as a home base at its core."

Am Abend haben wir ein Family-Dinner mit Van‘s Familie gemacht. Van hat alles frisch gekocht und es gab sogar selbstgebrannten Reisschnaps. Das Family-Dinner können wir sehr empfehlen. Die Aussicht und die umliegende Natur sind wunderschön und es gibt sehr süße Hunde und Katzen. Wer in Du Già übernachtet, sollte die Nacht auf jeden Fall in dieser Unterkunft verbringen. In fast 4 Wochen Vietnam war das das Authentischste, was wir erleben durften und das zu einem günstigen Preis :) Vielen Dank, gerne wieder!!<br/>P.s: das Haus ist offen und einfach - es gibt zwar ein großes Moskitonetz, dennoch sollte man sich auf den Besuch von Insekten einstellen"

She, her husband, the whole family are superlovely people, the house is nicely located with beautiful views and a large terrace. We took the chance to have dinner with them and it's 100% worth it and very delicious. Afterwards we sang several rounds of karaoke with them and had some corn  liquor. We strongly recommend to stay at this place if you want to have a bit of distance to the partying biker groups. Thank you Van and Chung. All the best!"

We stayed before and after the Loop and felt like we were coming home!<br/>Thai kept our luggage safe for us whilst we did the Loop which was such a help.<br/>Thai’s home is in a quiet area way from all the crowds. We slept so well. The bed is comfortable with good quality linen. A fridge in the room. Clean bathroom and hot shower.  We could use the kitchen to cook our breakfast too. <br/>It’s about a 15/20 min walk into the centre but if you want to have a chilled start and end to the Loop away from the tours then Thai’s place is perfect. Thank you Thai and to your daughter for making us feel right at home ❤️"

The room was spotless and modern with, with a great attached bathroom. Perfectly comfortable and quiet for resting - I had the strong impression that if I had had more time in the area, Thai would have set me up with some great ideas for things to do!"

You can hear some roosters in the morning, but this didn't bother us much, as we were getting early in the morning.<br/>The house is modern and nicely decorated. <br/>Thai was really nice to keep our luggage safe till we were doing the Ha Giang Loop, which was very helpful to us. <br/>Although we are used to a different, higher standard of clean, overall the rooms were clean.<br/>If you prefer a more quiet, modern and private location, Thai's place is a very good choice."

I have been several times and she has just built a beautiful new home that makes you feel like home when you’re there. Not only is her place beautiful but the location is amazing and she is beyond helpful as she speaks great English. She organized our taxi pick up for an amazing price from Hà Nội airport and took care of arranging renting us motorbikes for the Ha Giang Loop. She also organized us to go with her friend to see the ancient tea forest. She is such a cool lady that has become a great friend to me and my family. I am so grateful the universe put her on my path and it was all from reading AirBnB reviews. If you’re looking for a a beautiful home to stay in with comfortable beds and all the amenities you could ask for before or after your Ha Giang Loop stay, this is the place. Much Love to you Thai for everything. She is also a wonderful cook"

Elle nous a réservé les billets pour accéder à Ha Giang et pour y repartir, a pris en charge l’organisation et les réservations pour le célèbre tour en moto (Ha Giang Loop), nous a trouvé un guide super sympa parlant anglais pour nous accompagner. De plus,son logement est très agréable, confortable et bien situé dans un endroit calme. Sa table familiale accueille aussi ses hôtes à dîner. En un mot, un modèle d’accueil Airbnb. Je recommande sans hésitation et chaudement!"

Her place is very clean and quiet. Thai helped us rent a motorbike that was delivered to her place the night we left before the loop. She helped us plan out our trip and booked our stays on the loop. Also, it was so nice to have a point of contact in Ha Giang while on the loop. She is so responsive and helpful. We will definitely stay here again when returning to Ha Giang."

The bungalow was very spacious and the balcony featured a hammock, a tropical setting with a direct view on the river below. The host was very helpful with our questions and he even kept our luggage while we left for the Ha Giang Loop."

We stayed there for one night to wind down after doing a four day Ha Giang loop. It was exactly what we needed. The bungalows are very spacious and have beautiful views. The food is all made from local produce as Nd with love by the family managing the property. It's not just an accomodation, it's a unique experience I'd recommend to everyone visiting Ha Giang."

We also had dinner there, which was very good and nice, with valuable exchanges. We really had a good time. Unfortunately it was a bit cold due to the season and we were not prepare for this.

We were able to walk and bike everywhere. Highly recommended!"

Er half uns mit dem Verleih eines Motorrads für den Loop (das echt top war!) und hätte auch mit der Transfer-Buchung für die Weiterfahrt danach geholfen, aber wir hatten leider schon selbst gebucht. Das Essen, dass seinen Neffen zaubert, ist absolut köstlich und der Preis dafür ist fair. Die Unterkünfte sind in liebevoller Handarbeit selbst gebaut inmitten der Natur. Wir würden jederzeit hier wieder übernachten! Lieben Dank für den sehr schönen Aufenthalt. 😍"

Właściciel niesamowicie uprzejmy i bardzo pomocny - zamówił nam taksówkę która o 3 rano przyjechała po nas na przystanek autobusowy, a sam czekal na nas w ośrodku, żeby przekazać domek. Pod domkiem możliwość kąpania się w rzece co było idealne w trakcie pobytu ze względu na upał.  Jedzenie pyszne. Zdecydowanie polecam"

Wir hatten ein privates Bungalow, welches direkt am Fluss liegt, zu dem ein wunderschöner Weg runterführt. Außerdem liegt die Unterkunft super auch für diejenigen, die Ha Giang nicht nur mit dem Motorrad erkunden möchten. Man kann loslaufen und ist direkt auf einer schönen Route, besonders empfehlenswert ist es, von der Unterkunft aus nach rechts zu laufen, über einen Bach hinweg und dann die erste Abzweigung zu nehmen, die nicht asphaltiert ist. Man gelangt zu Reisfeldern mit Wasserbüffeln und Häusern. <br/>An dem Family Stay ist The Anhs gesamte Familie beteiligt, wodurch man sich direkt zuhause fühlt. Samstags essen alle beim Family Stay zu abend und es macht super viel Spaß. Zudem ist das Abendessen jeden Tag wirklich unglaublich lecker und besteht nur aus regionalen Produkten. <br/>Die Gastgeber waren sehr freundlich. Sie haben uns eine tolle eintägige Motorradtour organisiert."

We had trouble finding the location, because Airbnb lists the address at a different location, but Tai was easy to reach and gave us directions. We would have had them in advance, but we arrived early. The family was very friendly. The food for dinner and breakfast was delicious. We would definitely stay again when we drive the loop next time."

's avonds hebben we enorm lekker gegeten. Maar dan is de karaoke begonnen... de grote groep jonge lui waren extreem luid en hebben ook 's nachts in de kamer boven ons nog veel lawaai gemaakt. Wij reizen met twee kinderen en dit was voor ons suboptimaal. Wij hadden graag in de advertentie gelezen dat er hier veel gedronken en gezongen ging worden. Om 7u 's ochtends begonnen de werken alweer. Wij raden het dus niet aan voor families, wel voor mensen die hier naar op zoek zijn."

The reception ladies were super friendly and incredibly helpful, we could book a bus to Hanoi that picked us up from the hotel, and the complimentary breakfast was fantastic! We will definitely send our friends and family your way come back to stay when we return to Ha Giang. It isn’t in the centre of town but they do provide bicycle and motorbike rentals and offer tours of the loop themselves anywhere from 1-5 days. The ammenities are beautiful, the soaps they use are natural and made by locals using natural ingredients and smell outstanding, plenty of towels and spare toothbrush/paste packets. They offer currency exchange here and are always available for assistance. Can’t say enough how wonderful this place is, thank you very much!!"

It definitely was the most luxurious accommodation of our while stay, but at the same rate we shall per per night. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, rooms are great and food is delicious. We also booked our 3 day motorcycle tour with them and can highly recommend! It was an amazing trip.<br/>The homestay is slightly outside of Ha Giang, but we saw the village when driving through and prefer a million times this beautiful and peaceful place."

Incredibly kind. <br/>She and her family stayed up and waited for us to check in and make us pizzas as we arrived into Ha Giang later than expected. So hospitable!<br/>They also have the cutest dogs. Rooms were spacious and clean. Huyen also called a taxi for us in the morning to get to our hostel ahead of the Ha Giang loop. If you want to get a private room before this trip I recommend staying here."

At 10:45 pm (shortly after arriving) we tried to leave to grab dinner (we had just gotten off a 7 hour bus from Hanoi and were hungry). We realized the hotel's front gate had been locked! We were locked in!! After contacting the host, a young woman appeared who tried to talk us out of leaving, saying she has class early in the morning. After stressing we needed to eat something, she told us we must be back by 12. We said we'd do our best. She finally unlocked the gate, and said regardless if we've returned or not, she will lock the front gate at 1.  Never before have I been given a curfew at an airbnb or hotel before!! Very strange and uncomfortable experience."

Mr. Cong, her friend and our driver for the tour, was also very kind and put in every effort to make us feel safe, comfortable, happy, and well-informed.

We got in really late from our travels around 11pm and she was making us homemade pizza since we were so starving. She helped us pick out a motorbike that would be good for us for the loop, arranged our transportation from Ha Giang to Sapa, and adjusted our dates of staying when we had to finish the loop a day early. She is so warm and friendly. She’s amazing. I would not want to stay anywhere else. <br/>Also! Have her banana pancakes in the morning. Soooo good!"

Once we were there, she helped us arrange a loop tour via car and we had an awesome time with our local guide and driver! We chose the 4D3N option and would highly recommend this, the second half of the loop has the most incredible views. We also did some trekking, visit local villages and businesses during our loop! We tried her pizza, which was delicious and were even treated with some of her other cooking - amazing tofu dish, sweet potato, stir fried mushroom and salad. If this is on offer, do not pass on it! It has was one of our favourite meals thus far during our months of travel. She suggested and booked us massages on our final night too, which was just the cherry on top. Staying with Huyen was beyond expectations. The hotel is lovely and peaceful. Ha Giang is more than just a motorbike loop, do not hesitate to visit and explore the region!"

Huyen booked our transfer  door-to-door from our Hanoi Airbnb right to her place! <br/>We enjoyed home made pizza, delicious ginger tea, and banana pancakes.<br/>There is a short hike up the hill behind the hotel to stretch your legs that we appreciated<br/>We walked to town several times. It's maybe a 10 minute walk and very enjoyable.  Easy to get to a small shop or find dinner if you're eating out of the hotel one night.<br/>Huyen also booked us a 7-night tour around the Ha Giang loop by car.<br/>A special shout-out to her daughter who was very helpful with recommendations, translating, and just generally a wonderful,  friendly person and her husband who also assisted with planning. A great family!"

She arranged everything for us from the bus to and from Hanoi, to a customized private car tour of the Ha Giang loop. Mr. Cong, the driver, is very kind and puts in the effort to make sure that we are enjoying and we are safe. He found ways to talk to us and tell us histories and facts about the places we visited. We learned a lot from him. He doesn't lack anything in service. And Ms. Huyen and her family are very welcoming and accommodating from start to finish. The food she prepared for us at breakfast (like banana pancake with honey) and dinner (her famous pizza) are very delicious. She and Mr. Cong made our visit to Vietnam very special indeed. They make us want to come back soon. Highly recommended! Thank you very much again!"

Immediately once I was showered and ready she made a delicious pizza for me and offered beer! There is also a small hiking trail attached to the back of the property with some great views of Ha Giang.<br/>Amazing family and Airbnb hosts! Would highly recommend to anyone!"

You won't find many homestays that are like this, perfect for travellers who are keen to visit a beautiful, off-the-beaten track area, and see a different way of life.<br/>If you are making your own transport to Bikki's Jungle Homestay, don't rely on the instructions from Google Maps! But Bikki can give good directions and she's a great communicator."

Highly recommended for tea lowers and those people who seek hotel amenities should abstain. Bikky's family was very friendly with us and Bikky was always  looking out for us. A pleasant experience that we'll always have in our memory."

I arrived in the night and when I woke up I was amazed by the rich landscape, warm and kind people, delicious food, and peaceful atmosphere. Bikki is doing something really special by offering guests a chance to live in her village and follow the incredible cultural traditions of the Red Dao Tribe. It was truly an honor. We went on break-taking hikes in the jungle, swam in stunning waterfalls, made tea from ancient tea trees, learned about local artisanal goods (jewelry, clothing, paper, chopsticks), and encountered the rich plant medicine of the land. Bikki is so helpful with anything you need and will create an unforgettable experience for you. I am in love with this stay. I hope I can visit Bikki and her family again soon, they have become part of my heart <3"

Nestled near a serene river and surrounded by lush forests, the location is nothing short of magical. Bik, our incredible host from the Doaz tribe, made us feel like family from the moment we arrived.<br/>The accommodations was cozy and beautiful, reflecting the rich culture of the area. Each morning, we were treated to delicious meals made from locally sourced ingredients—Bik’s cooking is truly a highlight! We enjoyed fresh herbs, vegetables, and meats, all bursting with flavor.<br/>Exploring the nearby trails and listening to the sounds of nature was a perfect way to unwind. Bik’s knowledge of the area added so much to our experience; she guided us through hidden gems and shared stories about her culture.<br/>If you’re looking for an authentic experience in Vietnam, this is it. I can’t recommend Bik’s homestay enough! We left with our hearts full and memories"

The workspace and Wi-Fi connection were excellent. The bathroom is inside the room, and there’s a kitchen where you can prepare your own meals. However, do bear in mind that only one of the three hob rings was working. That said, it wasn’t an issue at all.<br/>The two young gentlemen responsible for housekeeping were polite and attentive. I truly appreciated their efforts to make me feel as comfortable as possible.<br/>I highly recommend this place for both short and long stays."

They offer good prices for the loop, single or easy rider, and Hai was incredible. I would be happy to stay here again."

Chung and her brothers made you feel right at home. This is a beautiful house right at the main road. There is plenty of food options. He also has motobike for rent for the Ha Giang Loop. According to my partner Tej those are good bikes, as he can see the way they took care of their bike. Thanks Chung and especially his brother for the pleasant stay. Thanh and Tej"

They sorted us out with a motorbike, protective pads, waterproofs and helped us tie the bags onto the bike. We organised the bus with them and the were great. The internet speed was extremely fast- good enough to do video calls which is what I needed. The location is also very central- only a few minutes work from the Main Street. Definitely recommend!

Was the perfect place to rest and base ourselves before we set off. <br/>We rented a bike too and it was spot on, no issues at all. We used it for 4 days and it was perfect for what we needed. We were also able to leave our bigger bags safely with them and collected when we dropped the bike off. <br/>Host is responsive and the young lad at the reception was helpful and accommodating.<br/>Simple place but perfect for what we needed.

It’s quiet and peaceful, perfect for unwinding and finding some peace of mind. Everything’s been taken care of down to the smallest details, from the decor to the overall atmosphere, making it feel like you're in the perfect healing space. Big thanks to chị “Mị” for always being there to chat, share, and stick with us throughout the trip. It’s because of her that I could find some calm in the middle of all the hustle. Wishing Mực and the two pups nothing but happiness and good vibes! I’ll definitely recommend this place to my friends ạaa"

The whole family is very sweet and earnest, and chú Anh in particular is very knowledgeable and connected within the community. The river behind the house is a favorite swimming spot amongst the local kids. Don't miss out on the communal dinners, a generous spread of vegetarian, fish, and meat dishes, accompanied by homegrown rice. Filtered mountain spring water on tap was a blessing. Truly the perfect place for relaxation and exploration; I look forward to returning."

My cabin had a balcony overlooking the river and the mountain. Ling, his nephew took me out in the nearby countryside to swim in waterfalls and hike in rice fields. we also had quite the crazy bike ride in the mountains. <br/>But most of all, it's their kindness, hospitality that made the stay even more valuable. I had a meal with the whole family on Freedom day. I met everyone. <br/>They made me feel very welcome and always very very helpful. <br/>My trip until then was complicated but they made everything seem so easy. Will recommend to all my friends."

The food here that you can have for breakfast , lunch and dinner is the best that we have had in Vietnam ! You should truly book this homestay as you won’t regret it. The land is so beautiful and there are some very friendly kittens. It’s so peaceful and again , swimming in the river is heavenly. The price can’t be matched and it’s easy enough to get a cab to the homestay and back or even to walk ! You can walk to town amongst farm land and animals."

The accommodation is fantastic and very quiet, with great views and a lovely river behind it.<br/>Anh was incredibly helpful, assisting us in booking the Easy Riders for the Ha Giang loop, which is a must-do if you're in the area.<br/> He even let us use the room for free for a few hours after we returned from the loop and had to wait for our bus to Sa Pa.<br/>The food was delicious, and the overall service was excellent.<br/> Definitely check out this place if you're around Ha Giang—you won't regret it!"

We had dinner there one night and the food was delicious, everything was fresh from the land. Our motorbike had some issues before doing the loop and we ended up staying a few extra nights. His Nephew even helped us out to take the motorbike to town to get a new battery. The bed has also been the most comfortable bed since we have been in Vietnam. Definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Ha Giang!"

It was the perfect spot to play my flute.<br/>Being with you for more than a week, was really relaxing for me and my girlfriend. Till we meet again! Cảm ơn bạn.<br/>For people scrolling the reviews: the accomodation is clean and wel maintained. You will find comfort there. The rooms can be noisy, but because of Anh personality he attracts guests that are respectfull to, and mindfull of each other. Very good vibes!<br/>Everyday there is the possibility of new people arriving that are planning to loop. That makes it a nice place to meet new people. <br/>Regardless of the duration of your stay, Anh will treat you with just a wonderful hospitality. While his and his nephew’s service are always on point, they respect your privacy and personal choices at all times.<br/>Last but not least: the food, my goodness, what a load of delicacies!"

Grâce à lui, nous avons pu vivre un moment inoubliable lors la boucle d'Ha Giang, pour laquelle il nous a confié à 2 super Easy Riders, issus de minorités ethniques et habitant à quelques pas de chez lui (nous vous conseillons d'ailleurs de lui demander ces deux chauffeurs, Kam et Zong ;-))<br/>Si vous souhaitez vivre une expérience 100%, nous vous encourageons à loger chez lui!

The bed and blankets were cozy and I slept well. ^^ I ordered coffee here a couple of times and it was so delicious! In addition, he was extremely helpful as I prepared for the Ha Giang loop: he let me store my bags for the days I was gone and when I returned helped me find a bus back to Hanoi.

The food (we had vegetarian) was truly delicious and it was really nice to have home-cooking. We enjoyed cycling around the lanes and seeing the landscape and everyday life unfold around us - and watching the fireflies by the stream in the evening. it was quite hot (38 C), so we also did a lot of sitting around and reading in the house, and it was a lovely place to be. We particularly appreciated that it was a quiet area and not touristy. Xoi was warm and super helpful. We were especially grateful for her help with transport to this fairly rural location."

We loved the spirit and the communal atmosphere - buzzing with live, yet thougtful and with care. The surroundings are beautiful, you can easily go around by bicycle and there is a nice public pool nearby. It is far from Hanoi, and in our experience the luxury minivan is 10x better than getting there by sleeperbus. I can recommend for those who are keen to enjoy a few days in a rural setting."

Le village est fantastique, très paisible et préservé du tourisme de masse, on y est accueillis comme des invités partout. Nous avons beaucoup aimé les balades et visites possibles à pied ou à vélo, faciles à organiser et la piscine municipale est top surtout avec les fortes chaleurs que nous avons eu. Un grand merci à Xoi et sa famille pour l’accueil et bravo à eux d’avoir fait ce lieu exceptionnel ! Je recommanderai cette adresse à mes amis qui prévoient de partir au vietnam !"

          "comments": "This place was a highlight for our family on our three week travels through Vietnam. After we arrived on our very long sleeper bus ride (not recommended) we were escorted by the family to our peaceful room with a river view. An absolutely delicious local menu meal was served using all of their organic farmgrown vegetables and meat. They also had wonderful vegetarian food available too. They served a huge variety of food and some of the tastes were definitely new and delicious to our palette. We took the bikes for many rides through the neighbouring towns where the locals were quick to smile. A very beautiful and peaceful people where all of the families care about one another and live in close community. It was not hard to feel very much at home. The Homestay was a great refuge after our adventures to unwind and chill with a beer or refreshment. The local cashew nuts were incredible. We ate all of their supply and were gifted the last bag as we left."

They cooked home made Vietnamese food every night and it was some of the best food I’ve ever had. They welcomed you in like you were family and it truly was an amazing experience would definitely recommend staying here."

Eating home cooked meals (feasts) with the family was incredible at the end of every day. The home we stayed in was just so beautiful, and very clean. <br/>It was so fantastic that we want to come back to Vietnam just to see our new friends/family in Lam Thuong again. Couldn’t recommend more!"

Xoi’s farm is like heaven, the food is more than authentic and sooo delicious - we had dinner with the family everyday and enjoyed every second of our stay. There is plenty to do and see, the neighborhood is heartwarming and lovely. <br/>We learned traditional hat making, went to the Nam Chan waterfall and did a tour with Eric to Pu lung Trang mountain - he cooked for us on the mountain, showed us eatable plants and watched over us every second. We thank everyone for this unforgettable time and we will definitely be back - cảm ơn family 🧡"

They fed us 3 spectacular meals every day and the area is even more beautiful than the pictures. We did a 14 km trek one day guided by one of the hosts and enjoyed a delicious picnic at the summit. Plenty of local food and shops, but there was little to no reason to ever leave the resort. Thank you so much to Xoi and the whole crew, 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay!"

Hier ontdek je het echte Vietnam en de mensen in Luc Yen zijn stuk voor stuk ontzettend aardig en hartelijk. We hebben genoten van de rust, de mooie natuur, de lekkere maaltijden en het contact met de locals. De bungalow is op palen gebouwd, zoals alle traditionele huizen van de Tai bevolking. Het is eenvoudig maar goed. Xoi helpt je bij het regelen van de busreis en eventuele activiteiten. De waterval is zeker een bezoek waard, maar het meest bijzondere is het contact met de mensen en de kinderen in de buurt. We hopen dat de boerderij en het dorp zijn authenticiteit en hartelijkheid altijd zullen behouden. We zullen Xoi en haar familie erg missen!"

The homemade breakfast was a wonderful touch and really made the stay feel special. Would definitely recommend and hope to come back again!"

The space is clean, cosy, and beautifully decorated — it immediately feels like home.<br/>What truly sets it apart is the host family. They are warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind. I arrived a stranger and left feeling I'd made real friends. We even shared a few meals together — moments I’ll genuinely treasure. I fully intend to keep in touch.<br/>Even with just a few days, Lihn made sure I got the most out of my time. She even found ways to help me save money while still giving me richer, more authentic experiences than any standard tour could offer. I highly recommend asking her about the nearby blacksmithing, incense, and paper-making villages — absolutely unforgettable.<br/>I only wish I’d had more time there. I can’t wait to return… after all, I think it’s definitely my turn to cook dinner next!"

In case of emergency, Hoanh accepts online payment.<br/>The family dinner was interesting, the happy water always breaks down the language barrier ;)"

Nur dort hin- und wieder wegzukommen ist etwas schwierig. <br/>Außerdem lohnt es sich die Preise für die von der Familie angebotene Bootstour, das Essen oder auch Roller mieten vorher zu erfragen - wir waren etwas überrascht da es dann doch nicht ganz so günstig wurde wie erwartet."

So ein großer Flecken Natur in der absoluten Idylle und Ruhe.<br/>Man kommt - wenn man keinen persönlichen Driver engagieren möchte - mit dem öffentlichen Bus zu der Anlegestelle der Boote und fährt mit dem Boot circa 15 Minuten auf die andere Seite (einfach dem Bootfahrer Hoanhs Namen sagen). Von dort läuft man circa 1 Kilometer, es ist das dritte oder vierte Homestay nach einer kleinen Kurve. <br/>Es wurden viele Freizeitaktivitäten angeboten, wir waren zum Beispiel einen 3/4 Tag Kayak fahren, wobei uns Hoanhs Vater (gegen Bezahlung natürlich) die ganze Zeit begleitet hat, wir konnten auf dem See mit ihm frühstücken und sind dann zu einer schönen Höhle gepaddelt/gefahren worden und anschließend zum Mittagessen Nahe eines Wasserfalls bei einer reizenden alten Dame, die das Essen günstig und frisch zubereitet - und in Fülle :D<br/>Abends haben wir (gegen Aufpreis) mit Hoanhs Vater/Mutter und weiteren Reisenden auf der Terrasse gegessen und getrunken, was unfassbar lecker und lustig war. Eine Karaoke-Maschine gab es auch für diejenigen, denen der Reisschnaps gut geschmeckt hat :P<br/>Man konnte sich immer Wasser, Tee und Kaffee holen, nebenan gab es auch einen kleinen Laden, in welchem man sich mit Essen und Trinken versorgen konnte. Auch wenn Hoanh selbst nicht da war und seine Eltern kein Englisch gesprochen haben, war er immer hilfsbereit und erreichbar - mit den Eltern hat man sich (mit Hoanh am Handy) und Händen und Füßen trotzdem gut verständigen können und sie sind unfassbar gastfreundlich und lustig. <br/>Wir haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen und wären gerne länger geblieben, da alles so schön naturnah und schlicht war :)"

We sliepen er 3 nachtjes, wat misschien wel ietsje te lang was voor ons aangezien er niet heel veel faciliteiten zijn zoals staat aangegeven, maar we kwamen goed tot rust! <br/>De communicatie was ook soms wat lastig maar het is goed gekomen! <br/>Er komen veel Franse tour-groepen in de avond slapen haha, elke avond zat het (toen wij er waren) helemaal vol! Blijkbaar is er een Franse documentaire gemaakt over dit dorpje ☺️"

Some love firm bed and it’s more traditional. But I’m a soft bed kinda guy. However they have very soft blankets and putting one of those under you did the trick for me. <br/>The host will go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable. <br/>An easy must see and experience.<br/>You won’t be disappointed if you book."

The road up to the homestay is such a fun ride but sadly has been affected by the recent landslides. Our host let us know this in advance and came out to make sure we made it up alright. We had dinner and breakfast there and the portions were very decent and delicious! We couldn’t believe how spacious and well-decorated it was and loved every second of our stay. Communal bathrooms were spotless and had everything you could need. One of our best stays in Vietnam so far!"

Super friendly, very clean (honestly, for us it has been the cleanest in all of our Vietnam accommodations), and in a great location. The projector screen in the room is such a wonderful touch!"

La chambre est jolie, cozy, le rétroprojecteur donne vraiment un sentiment de confort supplémentaire, l’impression d’être dans un cocon! <br/>La cuisine commune est un plus à ne pas négliger.<br/>Merci pour tout Tô!"

Die Aussicht und die Fenster sind einfach grandios und die Gastgeberin sehr nett. Ja, die Straße ist die letzten 400m etwas schwierig, aber machbar (auch mit Moped) - dafür wird man dann eben mit der Aussicht belohnt. Wie so häufig finde ich, dass es nicht mehr wirklich ein Homestay ist, sondern eine Art Hostel/Hotel, aber dennoch eine Reise wert wer in der Nähe ist :)"

Es war für uns auf jeden Fall okay, wir hätten es nur gerne früher gewusst. Es gibt eine Küche die man mitbenutzen kann und immer frisches Trinkwasser, was super war. Wir würden die Unterkunft von Lan auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen. <br/>Wir haben eine Trekking Tour gebucht, durch die haben wir eine andere Seite von Vietnam kennengelernt, dörflich und sehr freundlich. Sie war leider etwas lang. Aber man kann bestimmt auch eine kürzere nehmen :)"

Trang heeft ons enorm geholpen met goede tips om de omgeving van Cao Bang te ontdekken en heeft een privé chauffeur voor ons geregeld. Het appartement heeft alles wat je nodig hebt om je thuis te voelen. Tegenover het appartement is een lokale markt waar je groenten en fruit kunt kopen en om de hoek zit een goede supermarkt voor de andere dingen. Een wandeling langs de rivier was erg leuk en natuurlijk de hoogtepunten Angel's Eye mountain, Ho Thang Hen lake en de Ban Gioc watervallen. Bedankt Trang!"

The host made an excellent dinner with beers and happy water. the following morning we woke up to beautiful views and were invited to swim in the stream. it was very refreshing. I would stay here again."

Det var vi meget glade for!<br/>Værelser og badeværelser var fine, men kunne godt trænge til mere rengøring og sengen var meget fast, og nok for hård for de fleste turister.<br/>Smuk udsigt over byen og huset lå trukket tilbage fra den travle gade.

Tout est à disposition : chambre avec salle de bain privée, cuisine, salle à manger typique. Le lieu est beau et reposant. <br/>Nous avons pu laver notre linge pour un prix très raisonnable (moins cher que les laundry) et y louer des scooters. Il nous a même gardé nos gros sacs 24h (sans compensation) pour que nous puissions aller à Ban Gioc. <br/>Pour couronner le tout, Nong et son ami sont très gentils.

The café itself has a really tasty selection of coffee, sweets fresh juices and  lunches. We enjoyed the open rooftop with a spectacular view on the river, town and some mountains. The room is spacious and clean, with a comfy bed and minibar. The whole space is esthetically pleasing."

Bed was comfy, bathroom were spotless and filled with all necessities.<br/>Tan was the one to welcome me during Thuyet and Nghia absence. He made this stay exceptional, took me to the market and with other people we also made a trek and actually survived !<br/>Food was delicious, Pheng and Mon family meals were so great that I’m already missing it …<br/>On the last day I finally met Thuyet and Nghia. Such amazing people they are. They shared with us the Lô Lô culture while eating in a traditional house of the village and took us to see the rice fields ! Thuyet also helped me for the bus back to Hanoi !<br/>Thank you so much for everything. I will definitely come back 😊"

Tan help me communicate with our driver for the next destination and sent me to the car as the road to the homestay is partly rocky. <br/>I also use their day tour to Meo Vac and Tan accompany me and help in translation. <br/>The staff also nice. You can try the black Lo Lo traditional dress and take photo without charge. <br/>The dinner is delicious even too much for a solo traveler like me. <br/>The place is a bit far from town but you can walk around and the newly construct culture house is up in the mountain."

Das Zimmer hat einen unglaublich schönen Ausblick auf die Reisterrassen und die umliegende Natur und die Badezimmer sind blitzsauber. Abends gab es herrliches vegetarisches Abendessen - wirklich unglaublich lecker. Ebenso das Frühstück. Zudem waren die Hosts total lieb, plauderten mit uns und gaben uns Tipps. Wir würden sofort wieder kommen, wenn wir je wieder in der Umgebung sind! DANKE für die tolle Zeit!<br/>Achja - und sowohl Netz als auch Internet gibt es vor Ort :) (Also für alle die aufgrund von Arbeit etc erreichbar sein müssen - man ist auch dort gut erreichbar)."

It's pretty solid, too.<br/>The only downsides I can think of were the location is a bit treacherous to get to, especially on a motorbike. They offer a service where you can be picked up from the main road though (it's not so bad really, just the last stretch of road going up the mountain is incomplete and rough).<br/>Also I can only imagine it could get a little noisy if there were loads of people staying because the divisions between rooms are not complete, so above the walls but below the ceiling there is open space, which makes the rooms feel a bit open.<br/>Other than that I really enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to go there again."

The place was even nicer than we expected, with a beautiful bathroom and such a comfy bed. They even refilled our water when we were out for the day! <br/>It’s a great location next to cafes, a bakery, and near the main road but not noisy at all. We were also helped with our laundry, which was left for us in a perfect neat pile. Thank you so much, we wish we had stayed longer!"

The place itself is very charming and is exactly as described on air bnb, just by the lake. The property is well kept and beautiful. The food the host served us was delicious and he also gave us vegetarian food as per request, he was kind enough to share their local wine with us. We enjoyed our stay here, we also went on hikes with the host’s guide and it was the best hike till date. Good kayaking fun very good recommendations given by the host."

Am besten die Koordinaten nochmals schicken lassen, falls eine individuelle Anreise ansteht.<br/>Das Essen, welches von Thuan‘s zubereitet wird, ist einfach sensationell. So lecker und schmackhaft!! Überhaupt ist die Frau die gute Seele des Hauses. Immer ansprechbar, hilfsbereit und so liebevoll!<br/>Ein eigenes Badezimmer gibt es nicht, das sollte man schon wissen. Und wenn alle Zimmer belegt sind, wird es schon eng. <br/>Ich würde auch Abstand davon nehmen, bei so vielen Zimmern noch von Homestay zu sprechen. Aber das mag Ansichtssache sein.<br/>Ich habe ja trotzdem die fünf Sterne gegeben, weil es eine schöne Zeit war.<br/>Vielen Dank 🙏🏽 dafür!"

Seul  bémol, on nous a servi les déjeuners tous les matins, sans nous poser de question, comme si c’était inclus. Au final, nous avons dû payer pour.

The homestay was clean and comfortable the food great and more than i could eat and the local rice wine was pretty tasty compared to the comercil stuff. Did a boat cruise down one of the rivers feeding into the lake that flows through a cave under a mountain befor entering the lake where they stopped the boat to let us swim over to a small island. With barriers set up on the roads to keep trucks off the roads in and around the area its a great place to walk cycle or hire a moto to explore the other small villages creeks caves. When i left after 3 days i was thinking this is a place id like to spend a week or two at.      "

Quelqu’un de la maison doit venir vous chercher à l’embarcadère si vous arrivez par le bus, il faut traverser le lac. Étant seule et non motorisée la seule option pour moi a été de louer un kayak pour découvrir le lac. Il y une route qui longe une partie du lac qui passe devant le home stay mais pas de sentier le long du lac à cet endroit. Au home stay, les dîners sont vraiment délicieux ! La chambre en bois est charmante. Je regrette de n’avoir pu vraiment communiquer avec la famille sur leur culture, je ne parle pas vietnamien et ils ne parlent pas anglais. Cette pause loin de l’agitation de la ville était vraiment relaxante."

Beautiful food, Thuan offers tours on his boat around the national park. The meals were so yum and 50,000 vdn which is so reasonable for how fresh and yum they were. My room was comfy, with air con and a fan. They helped me book my transport to my next place. Use translate to talk with them as they mostly speak Vietnamese. They were warm and kind to me during my stay, I felt rejuvenated and relaxed. Thanks you Thuan and family!"

          "comments": "Hi 👋🏼 <br/>So, we generally went to Ba Be for the cave visits and had an absolute blast! The location of the apartment was very close and easy for us to get picked up by the tour company. <br/>The women at the AirBnb were extremely friendly and cute, went out of their way to accommodate for our needs including cooking for us a bunch. <br/>Amenities wise, the pool was nice but wasn’t the cleanest. But again, I just took the net and just cleaned it quickly myself and then all was good. You can also rent bikes directly from them.<br/>In terms of the rooms, black painted walls… why?! Room was sometimes warmer inside than outside (and that’s saying something as it was 35C outside). Rooms were very clean but had to change room due to the first night the room had a big gap in the ceiling on the 2nd floor and we got soooo many bugs that we literally couldn’t sleep all night<br/>The second room, the 2nd floor A/C wasn’t working so the room got very warm. <br/>Generally the experience was pleasant but nothing WOW!"

It has a beautiful view and is very near to the nearby attractions like the cave and lake. Bumpy roads to reach this place so have to be good in biking and be careful. Top up your fuel too as there are no gas stations nearby. food places are accessible from the local stalls/homestays around. this place can provide decent meals too if required. Host is super helpful and friendly, going all out to help us and being really responsive. he can help arrange for boat tours or kayaking plans too. It was a pleasant stay here ☺️"

The rooms are big and bright!<br/>It is possible to do a boat tour with the tenant, rent kayaks they also offer dîner (110) and breakfast sometimes (60), both very delicious. We are also mixed with other guests for meals so it gives a nice convivial atmosphere. <br/>On a lesser nice note, there was no hot water, and prior to our visit we were exchanging messaged with the Airbnb host which was really helpful, but once there, the tenant and his family do not speak English at all and even with the translator it was a struggle, which lead to misunderstandings (regarding bus bookings for example) and that made us a lil uncomfortable."

If you're contemplating whether to visit, well we can tell you it is probably the most memorable part of our trip. <br/>Our stay with Mr. Son and his family was lovely - they go out of their way to make you feel at home, Mrs. Son is a wonderful cook and I strongly recommend her cooking - we ate dinner with them every night and it was some of the best food I ate in Vietnam. Otherwise, this is not a state of the art 5star hotel - it is a comfortable home. The aircon is good, wifi is good, there's hot water. <br/>You can also ask Mr. Son to take you exploring the lake and visit several sites, he more or less goes at your pace, and the price is very reasonable. It's definitely worth it. There are also motorcycles available for rent, and the traffic is nothing like the cities, so you can confidently explore the area, which is another great adventure by itself. You will see farms, rivers, mountains, waterfalls. Ask Mr. Son or Mrs. Son for advice on where to explore and they will guide you."

Zum vergleich: eine große Schüssel phố kostet in Hanoi 40.000 Đống."

The guests are very kind people, so they took care of me, who is not natural in English, and I had dinner with them, and it was a very pleasant experience. Thuan also introduced me to a professional local guide named Tuoi, so I could tour pac ngoi village and hua ma cave.  It was the most enjoyable time I had in Vietnam. Meals served at the homestay were plentiful. It was unfortunate that there was noisy during the day due to road construction near the homestay.  Also, it is easy to see the nearby area only by bicycle or motorcycle. Before making a reservation, the bicycle was said to be free, but when I went there, I had to pay 50k vnd to rent it for a day.  I wanted to go directly from the homestay to Noi Bai Airport, and I was grateful that the host responsibly booked the bus.  The nature around the homestay is very beautiful and peaceful, so I was able to heal."

He went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable and arrange activities for us even though it overlapped with a local holiday. He took time to talk with us and explain about local customs and the holiday. The lake is a quick motorbike ride and we enjoyed kayaking and a boat trip he arranged for us. I would highly recommend! He also has excellent English so if you don’t speak Vietnamese there won’t be an issue."

He organized arrival & departure for us and had suggestions what to do in the area. For example, he organized a boat trip to cave and waterfall for us.<br/>In Ba Be and the surrounding area, it is probably recommended to be able to drive a motorcycle, otherwise you are very tied to the hotel area (by foot you can reach small shops and do some hiking / walking) or you have to make \"supervised\" day trips. A tour to the national park costs 30-60$ / person depending on the type of activity.<br/>Luans wife, Nhi, cooked us tastefull and extensive vegetarian dinner for around 8$ per person, even though we were partly the only guests there.<br/>The room was clean and spacious, just the couch lacked a bit of comfort. So we would recommend this accommodation for people who are mobile and on the search for outdoor activities or as a stopover on a trip through the north."

The food is all home cooked local cuisine and you will not go hungry. There is plenty of food for breakfast and dinner.  What made the visit special was Luan's warm and welcoming manner.  He arranged my tour on the lake and advised me on a walk to take through local villages. I wish I had been able to stay longer."

Then you meet the smiley and welcoming face of Vi (who speaks english fluently) and the sweet kindness of Trang and you definetely fell in love with this place. The room is bright, spotlessy clean, with a big king size bed, free Wi-Fi, a big new bathroom, airconditioning (for cooling and heating), kettle, hair dryer and all necessary toiletries. Again you feel so welcomed, confortable and relaxed. They can provide meals, a laundry service on demand and free bikes to discover the city. This homestay is the essence of Vietnam itself: beauty of semplicity, recycling, honesty, welcome, respect for people and nature, artcraft, hard work, strong mind, joy and gratitude for life, positive energy, good food, friendship, relaxed mood, family values, wisdom. You enter as a guest, you (sadly) leave as a friend."

The room was perfect, comfy, super clean and private, we loved the yoghurt and fruit breakfast here we ate it 3 days in a row! Vi is super helpful, she arranged our transfers to and from, she helped us hire scooters to get around Yen Bai, helped us make a reservation for dinner, and answered all of my many questions. Very prompt, very good English, super kind - all of the staff here were really kind too. <br/>The price was probably a bit higher than what we paid at other stays in Vietnam, but the quality was incredible, completely worth it in my opinion.<br/>Oh and the cafe garden is home to a couple of very sweet kittens, we loved when they visited whilst we had coffee.<br/>We will definitely return if we come back to Vietnam!"

Beyond the exceptional location, the magnificent accommodations and the delicious food, Vi was certainly the most memorable encounter of our trip. If we weren't separated by a 15-hour flight, we'd come every weekend! We were able to try out several rooms during our stay, and they were all perfect, quiet and comfortable. The place is extremely relaxing, and beautiful. We were able to stay long enough to enjoy it in all weathers, it was very contemplative, the garden is magnificent. The welcome was warm, kind and gentle, just like Vi who looked after us throughout our stay. The food was generous and delicious! This stay was perfect, thank you very much for everything, we hope to come back one day 🤞🏼bisous, Nolwenn and Etienne"

We loved our time at Dinh Gia Trang, which offers the traditional feeling of a bamboo stilt house but includes all the modern luxuries. Everything was so clean and classy, and the garden and rooms are very well looked after. Vi was so friendly and helped us with our travel to and from Yen Bai, as well as local recommendations to visit nearby and a scooter we could hire to get around. The cafe also provides delicious food and drinks! We left feeling so refreshed and connected to nature. Cannot recommend this place enough :)"

Since the host is an artist, every corner of the home feels thoughtful and creative. The warm tones, combined with greenery and flowers around the house, create a peaceful atmosphere that feels both like a safe haven and a place deeply connected to nature.<br/>The amenities were surprisingly complete and very well maintained. Everything was clean, neatly arranged, and far exceeded my expectations, especially for a home located in the city of Yen Bai.<br/>What made the experience even more special was the host. I didn’t feel like just a guest. I felt like a friend, or even a part of the family! Their kindness and sincerity made me feel right at home, and it’s the kind of place that makes you want to come back again."

Everyone there is very sweet; Vi especially is not only a responsive and enthusiastic host, but someone who genuinely connects with those who cross paths through her humor and conviction. The accommodations were very comfortable (although sound leaks easily) and Vi simplified our travels by arranging our transfers from the airport and to our next destination. Our spirits felt restored after just one night, and we would love to stay longer on our next visit."

          "comments": "I recently stayed at a homestay in Yên Bái, and it was one of the most peaceful and memorable experiences I’ve had in Vietnam. From the moment I arrived, I was welcomed with warmth and genuine hospitality by the host family. They made me feel like more than a guest — I felt like part of their home. <br/>The location is surrounded by lush green mountains and morning fog that gives the whole place a magical feel. Every morning, I woke up to the sound of birds, the scent of wood fire, and the fresh mountain air. The scenery is breathtaking — it’s the kind of place where you just want to sit quietly, sip tea, and take in the beauty of nature.<br/>The homestay itself was clean, cozy, and well-maintained. The wooden house has a traditional charm but is still comfortable, warm blankets, and even hot showers. <br/>This place is perfect if you’re looking to escape the city, connect with nature, and experience authentic local life. It’s not luxury — it’s something better: real, grounded, and full of soul."

Dinner was excellent, and the home-made rice wine was to die for. His family is very welcoming, and you feel right home with them. I could not have asked for a better place to stay!"

Ai hat großartig gekocht, zu unserer großen Freude vegetarisch. Phuong hat uns Vorschläge für Unternehmungen gemacht, die viel Spaß gemacht haben. Zum Beispiel sind wir mit seinem Schwiegervater über den See gefahren, es war eine richtig schöne Tour. Am besten war es, dass wir im Laufe der fünf Tage so viel über Vietnam und über das Leben hier erfahren haben - über die Sprache, über die Geheimnisse des vietnamesischen Straßenverkehrs und vieles mehr. Wir sind sehr dankbar, dass Phuong und Ai uns so freundlich aufgenommen haben, und uns so einen bemerkenswerten und schönen Aufenthalt geschenkt haben."

With a beautiful garden and no immediate neighbors, we could relax, laugh, and enjoy ourselves without worry. The peaceful atmosphere made it feel like a true retreat.<br/>The location is perfect, away from noisy main roads, offering pure tranquility. And the kitchen—wow! Spacious, airy, and perfect for cooking, especially with fresh organic vegetables from the garden and generous neighbors who share their delicious homegrown produce. The garden even has grapefruit and papaya trees, so we enjoyed fresh fruit straight from nature!<br/>Finally, the host is beyond amazing—100 out of 10! Incredibly kind, always available, and quick to help with anything.<br/>If you’re looking for a peaceful, well-equipped, and truly special place in Yen Bai, this is it. We’d absolutely stay again. Thank you for an unforgettable experience! ❤️"

The host is amazing, the food even better and the location at the lake is just wonderful. The host offered us a kayak to float around the lake. It was breathtaking. Furthermore the bungalow was perfectly clean, very modern and new. <br/>This AirBnB is new, so don't be fooling yourself not to go here if you just read the lack of reviews. It's a hidden diamond! Go for it!"

          "comments": "Recently constructed guesthouse in a heavenly location. Set right on the bank of a small lake, this spot is the quiet and peaceful getaway you need from the polluted, noisy Hanoi.<br/>The rooms are well built with a modern standard, including a big TV, proper AC, and large windows letting in lots of light. Everything was clean and good as new.<br/>The small rooms are on the ground floor and the views could have been nicer if the building was slightly nearer to the lake itself - climbing to the upper floors provides a proper vista.<br/>The host, Dzung, was very friendly and welcoming, and it was enjoyable to hang out with him and learn about his life. He offers kayaking (free) and jetski rental (paid), as well as a dinner and breakfast made by his family.<br/>All in all a wonderful place to stay with very few, if any, things to mind. Well worth the 3 hour trip from Hanoi, but slightly overpriced for Vietnamese standards."

There is an AC so that you can set the room temperature you want. The bathroom is very nice. It has no windows and is therefore open. <br/>The property is very beautiful and has many traditional details. It is very easy to relax with the calm music, the green surrounding and the lovely decoration. <br/>There is also a small restaurant on the property where you can book good breakfast and dinner, as well as coffee and snacks for reasonable prices. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you very much, Vi! We definitely recommend this accomodation :)"

The place are ideal for family but without seniors because there are about 250 steep walk from the mainroad. We enjoy the place because of the mountain view. This is better than booking a hotel if you'll be exploring Catcat and Fansipan and come back to rest. Wifi is good, and they provide dribking water, coffee, tea and rice crackers as soon as you need something in the morning. The host is very responsive and he booked us a private car service for the wholeday for 700dong only. We went to Cat Cat Ville, Alpine Coaster, and Moana. We will be back and book again"

Just 5 minutes walk to the bus station adn about 10 minutes to the centre. The AC and hot water worked so well, and I loved the most balcony on the 2nd floor where I can have the nice view of the town and mountain.<br/>They also prepared snacks, coffee, tea at the guests room which is so realxing with sofas.<br/>It was tottaly worth the money!!"

I also got lost when i was on my way back and received a text that the dogs around the neighbourhood are aggressive at night. There are really a lot of big dogs, and they come in packs too. There were also a lot of female locals who will run after you to sell their items. Beautiful view, but i didnt rly have a peaceful mind being here."

This place is peaceful both in the day and night. <br/>The rooms were clean and looks newly renovated, the aircon is cold and the heated water is a plus. <br/>The staff running this place were the best ! they helped me arranged everything from the motorbike rental/taxi rides as well as trekking tours starting from my arrival to my departure. <br/>If you are looking for a beautiful, clean and comfortable place away from the sapa town but still within reach, this is the place you are looking for."

Von Touren bis Taxen ist alles möglich. Die Bungalows sind wunderbar ausgestattet und haben einen tollen Blick in die spektakuläre Umgebung. Unbedingte Reiseempfehlung! Schnell und günstig mit dem Taxi oder Roller von sapa town erreichbar."

The view of the rice fields was breathtaking. <br/>The homestay was very clean, cozy, and had such a relaxing vibe. The host was incredibly accommodating, they even helped us book a taxi going to and from the homestay, which made our travel smoother. Plus, there was a free breakfast. <br/>It’s a bit of a drive (around 30 minutes) from the main town of Sa Pa, so it’s best suited for those looking for a peaceful escape rather than city convenience. There aren’t many shops or restaurants nearby, but honestly, the tranquility and the warm hospitality made it all worth it.<br/>Would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting to unwind, be close to nature, and experience a more authentic side of Sa Pa. 💚"

Durch die Klimaanlage, die auch als Heizkörper funktioniert, hatte man es angenehm warm im Zimmer. Die Lage war super und der Blick wirklich sehr schön, wir würden es definitiv weiterempfehlen!! <br/>Lediglich die Lobby, wo man frühstückt, ist bei kaltem Wetter ungemütlich, da es dort genauso kalt ist wie draußen. Ebenfalls hat das warme Wasser für maximal 5 Minuten duschen gereicht, dann musste man wieder warten. Das war allerdings nicht schlimm und wir hatten eine wirklich schöne Zeit in dem Bungalow!!"

Basic but comfortable it offers a unique opportunity to blend in with nature yet still be only a 5 or 10 minute walk into the township.<br/>Not for the light hearted, the 300 step climb is a bit of a workout, but it’s well lit and stepped and not dangerous.<br/>I’d recommend dining with the family to get a taste of the local foods for a very reasonable price.<br/>Thoroughly recommend this place-"

The loft is amazing with heated matters for the cold nights, it gives you the feeling of \"cabin in the woods\" but it's also very clean (spotless). <br/>Overall perfect place to stay<br/>Big bonus the doggos 🐶 that are running around, especially the brown retriever 🥰"

I felt right at home, the team is always very responsive, taking good care of us, even with vegan food which's not yet very popular in Sapa. I regret not booking tours with Jungle, as we didn't know they provide it. Ask a lots of things about tours as they offer the most authentic ones, from nighting out to trekking with locals or riding motobikes onto Hoang Lien Mountains. Try at least one of their home-cooking dinners and don't forget to have some shots from local ethnic cultures :)<br/>Hope to be back soon!"

She really went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and happy. 😊<br/>- My room was very clean and had amazing views.<br/>- I ate most of my meals here, all of which were very affordable and delicious. Nga provided generous portions with fresh ingredients.<br/>- Nga booked a trekking tour for me. She asked me what I wanted to see/experience and organized just that (waterfalls for swimming, paths through bamboo forests, etc.).<br/>- I met some of her family members during my stay, all of whom were warm and kind!<br/>I'd recommend this homestay to anyone who wishes to have a memorable experience in Sapa!!"

La habitación y baño son bien confortables , el colchón es un poco duro para nuestro gusto, pero es cuestión de gustos. Todo estaba muy nuevo y limpio.<br/>Nga nos hizo desayunos y comidas muy ricas, y con un precio súper accesible.  Hicimos el trekking con ella como guía y fue una experiencia única. Recomendamos hacerla!<br/>En el barrio Ta Van, que queda a unos 13 km  (taxis entre 200.000 y 250.000 Dong) del centro de Sapa, hay vistas hermosas y varios mercados pequeños , bares e restaurantes donde se puede estar sin necesidad de ir al centro. <br/>Nos encantó nuestra estadía, y volveríamos💛"

The place also has steep stairs when going around but it is all worth it for the view. <br/>For the food, expect regular home cooking. We found it really good though"

The view was stunning when you got it (Quite foggy when we went). The hut is located in a resort with a few different huts and the area is beautifully managed and feels private. The only downside is the location which is remote and away from the main attractions, Sa Pa and restaurants. Harder to get taxi/grabs because the road is pretty bumpy/bad to navigate as you'll find out. Hosts were very helpful and have a small menu for breakfast and dinner with veggie options. Thank you for letting us stay"

During our stay it was rainy and the view was just white with fog. The staff are accommodating. Appreciate them helping us out with our luggages since it’s a stairway path to the room. The food is okay too. You have the option to have it brought in the room. Was only disappointed that the pool was inaccessible. It was not even properly kept so we were not even able to take photos from that spot. Wish it was mentioned to us upon booking. All in all, if your timing is right and the weather bears with you, it’s worth the price for the view and peaceful vibe of the place."

The cabin itself also provides amazing panoramic views of the fields below – that is, if you’re lucky. During half of our stay the fog was too thick. Luckily it did clear up in the afternoon and the next morning. The room smelled weird but everything was clean. Hot water did not work. <br/>We brought our own food and ordered white rice & omelette from the kitchen as they didn’t have halal option. But they accommodated our request and even advised us which of their breakfast menu contained pork/meat. Nice stay to just chill. We took the recommended taxi and as expected the ride was pretty rough but I’d say it was worth a stay for one night."

The host is incredibly friendly and helpful, making the stay even more enjoyable. The location is great too, close to Cat Cat Village and surrounded by the beauty of Sapa’s mountains and valleys. Just a heads-up: there are some stairs to reach the room"

Tôi đã có dịp lưu trú tại một homestay nhỏ xinh nằm cheo leo trên sườn núi, nơi mà mỗi sáng thức dậy là khung cảnh mây mù lững lờ trôi ngang hiên nhà, ruộng bậc thang xanh rì trải dài vô tận. Không khí ở đây trong lành, mát lạnh và tinh khiết đến mức chỉ cần hít thở thôi cũng đủ thấy dễ chịu. Người dân địa phương thì thân thiện và hiếu khách đến lạ – họ sẵn sàng chia sẻ bữa cơm, câu chuyện, và cả những tiếng cười. Điều khiến tôi ấm lòng nhất là sự xuất hiện của vài chú chó dễ thương luôn lẽo đẽo theo tôi mỗi lần đi dạo. Cảm giác như được trở về với thiên nhiên, với sự giản dị và chân thành hiếm có – một nơi đáng để quay lại thêm nhiều lần.<br/>Ngoài ra Pavi còn 1 khu vườn nơi bạn có thể trải nghiệm vẽ tranh với sự hướng dẫn của cô chủ. Bạn có còn thể tự vẽ tranh và mang về. Rất cảm ơn vì trải nghiệm thú vị này"

The breakfast was amazing and the view also (if it wasn’t foggy). The host was always so polite and chatty, recommending us things and telling us more things about Sapa :D I will always remember his hospitality and the conversation I had with him — definitely recommend this place if you need a local stay with nice people and nature!!

The weather was bad and it was cold outside, but my room was very warm. There were some mosquitoes, and they immediately helped me with mosquito coils. Of course, it’s a very simple place, where you might find some insects (it’s right in the middle of the rice fields), but the view in the morning as soon as you wake up is truly refreshing.  <br/>I highly recommend it!"

The location is slightly out of the way as it’s in the mountains, but you can arrange a driver with the host Jack who is always responsive and helpful. He allowed us to check in early with a small fee, which was fine with us as we arrived at 6am and needed a space to freshen up.<br/>Jack is also such a great chef and cooked amazing meals for us! He provides great tips on where to visit in Sapa, and facilitates private treks with the local Hmong villagers who are so kind and helpful.<br/>Do note however that if you’re visiting in Summer, bugs are inevitable. There were a few that flew in but Jack kindly fitted some door stoppers to block them out. They also helped to clean our room when we requested for it. Overall, we truly enjoyed our entire experience at the homestay and I would definitely stay at Pavi Home again!"

The place has amazing scenery and its hosts are so so so helpful and very accommodating. They helped us with everything and we pretty much used every suggestion. The rooms are very nicely designed with a huge window looking out to the mountains and ricefields. This offer is for people who love very authentic experiences - from the tea to the trekking with the local tour guide and herbal bath! We absolutely loved it and we want to come back in summer time next time 💕 a big plus for the friendly dogs and cats 💕"

You can also simply hire a scooter from the accommodation. The host of the accommodation is always friendly and incredibly accommodating. It made our stay even sweeter. The accommodation is a clear recommendation for Sapa, especially if you want to stay in the \"jungle\"."

The room was clean and comfortable, and came with a mosquito net for bugs. Bathroom had real shampoo, and lots of extras in case you forgot anything. <br/>Our Host was very welcoming and responsive, and helped us book a cheap cab when we left. Cheap scooter rentals as well! The homemade meals were some of the best we have had on our trip so far. 10/10 would stay here again!"

The staff were friendly and kind and the space was spectacular. The only downside is the town square plays loud music until around 10pm at night, but afterwards it is peaceful and quiet. A lovely stay for a couple especially if you prefer being out of the main part of the city 🌿✨"

We were given an electric blanket and heater as it got cold at night. Any questions or concerns we had they were easily answered and taken care of for us! This is a great place to unwind and take in the beautiful views of Sapa, so highly recommend booking here for your travels 😊"

She will always help you get to your locations, and always greet you with a warm tea. The only downside is that if you come in winter it may be a bit cold. There is a portable heater and plenty of blankets available though. The walk up is a bit of a hike but I recommend this as a good point because it gets really noisy at night in the main streets and you wouldn't be able to rest properly there."

( d’ailleurs c’est assez sport pour y accédé  avec les valises ) <br/>Tous le personnel étaient aux petits soins . Les activités étaient organisés à l’avance et j’ai payé à la fin .  <br/>Sapa c’est magnifique et loger dans cette cabane à rendu notre voyage exceptionnel. <br/>Merci 🙏🏻♥️"

Highly recommend staying here"

The views are absolutely breathtaking — especially from the pool, which overlooks the valley and makes for the perfect sunset spot. Sunrise is just as magical, with several viewpoints on the property that offer panoramic 360-degree views after just a short walk up a few stairs.<br/>Our host, Hanna, was fantastic. She was incredibly responsive, super helpful, and speaks excellent English. She knows the area inside out and gave us great local tips that made our stay even more memorable.<br/>We highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Sa Pa — peaceful, scenic, and welcoming in every way!"

The cleanliness of the bathroom and linens could be improved. The hotel is located about 30 minutes away (on foot) from the nearest good restaurants, and the walk involves quite a bit of climbing. To avoid walking along a busy road for an hour, we chose to have dinner at the hotel.<br/>Dinner must be ordered in advance, and it’s not possible to add dishes on the spot like in a regular restaurant. While the food was nice, it’s tricky to know exactly how much you’ll want to eat ahead of time.<br/>After a few days, we moved to another accommodation in the heart of a village where we could easily walk to different restaurants — we personally preferred being closer to more dining options.<br/>One unpleasant experience was being woken up by loud karaoke around 10:30 pm, which continued past 11:30 pm."

The rooms were squeaky clean and special shout out to the host Huong who let us checkin early with a small fee and also upgraded us to villa room by taking just 100,000 dong per day! Although the airbnb mentioned kitchen in the list of amenities but let me tell you guys, no they do not have any kitchen. <br/>But our host Huong was so kind to let me cook my baby food in her restaurant kitchen, again thanks to her. <br/>Also, the swimming pool provides a spectacular view!! We had a fun time swimming in that beautiful surrounding, mountains and rice fields view was breathtaking!!"

It is a gem.<br/>The breakfast can be less plain, maybe. Still the pancakes were nice"

Le signal wifi est correct et la télévision est connectée à internet. La literie est propre et le lit confortable (un peu dur pour ceux qui aiment les matelas mous, mais cela ne nous a pas dérangés). Nous avons pu louer des scooters pour nous balader aux alentours à un prix très correct : deux jours pour 350 000 dongs. Pour le petit-déjeuner, vous avez le choix entre deux plats (phở ou banh mi aux œufs) avec thé ou café.<br/>Nous avons également utilisé le service de taxi (200 000 dongs par trajet) de l’hôtel au centre-ville de Sapa (8 km).<br/>Il propose également un service de spa/massage/bain, etc. Nous n’avons pas eu le temps de tester ces services.<br/>Pour un petit coin de paradis à Sapa, je vous le conseille pour la vue, la tranquillité, la gentillesse, le confort et la propreté des lieux. 😁"

She includes a bed net which was great. The food was amazing and you enjoy it with a breath taking view. 20/30 min drive to town, many shops and restaurants and nearby any excursions. Colder than Hanoi for sure, needed sweatpants and a sweater. I really enjoyed my stay here. And Hoang and her staff made sure I had everything I needed."

The host was incredible, we had a minor issue and she was so understanding and helped straight away. The free breakfast was a nice touch and very yummy. If you’re coming for a getaway in the mountains this is the perfect place! Not very close to much else but they have a restaurant. About 10 minutes drive from alpine rollercoaster and 30 mins from town. Such a lovely stay- thank you !!"

While it was around 30 minutes away from the city, the stay made it all worthwhile. The mesmerizing view coupled with friendly caretakers (and two adorable dogs) made the stay worthwhile. Highly recommend!"

We ordered bbq set for 2 and they gave us a lot. I think it would be enough for 4 people. Would have been better of they also offered rice. Since it was foggy day, we did not see the view as expected. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay as it was very peaceful and relaxing there."

Included breakfast was great, and we ordered dinner in our room. Tub is outside and is visible from other locations, so I'd recommend a swimming suit if you are to use it. We rented a motorbike in town and drove to the airbnb ourselves (though the host offers to arrange taxi pickup). It was a very adventurous drive, but if you are down for adventure, it was incredible. Be sure to set your directions to the \"walking\" path from Sa Pa, it will cut the drive in half (took us about 25 minutes, vs 45 on main road). The alpine slide is also on the drive, which is well worth the stop. Highly highly recommend, it's like Switzerland 2.0. Be warned, the doors do not seal fully on the bottom, so there were a couple creepy crawlies, but worth it for the views!"

          "comments": "The place had absolutely stunning views, no matter the weather. It was at the top of a mountain, and the room reflected that fact with some rock features, but that left a lot of homes for bugs. We spent a month in Vietnam, so bugs weren't surprising, but this place took it to a new level.  A mosquito net was provided. The pool was right above the room but was not maintained, so it was half full and a breeding ground for bugs, adding to the issue. It also wasn't the cleanest, with some hygiene concerns. There was mold due to the humidity. The place was also a long way from town, despite being only a couple of kilometers away. That is not the host's fault, and they had a kitchen that served fine food. It is important to note, in case you are like us and don't have a motorbike, that there was hardly anything besides one open restaurant within walking distance. The hosts were friendly and the property had plenty of photo area. It is the Rock Garden Homestay on Google."

Waking up to a sea of clouds covering the valley of terraces in Sapa was a priceless experience. The hosts were also very helpful in linking us up with transportation service from Hanoi to the AirBnB stay and to a local taxi driver to help us get back and forth from the Airbnb Stay to Sapa Town Proper. The road itself going to the Airbnb stay is a bit rocky but you could see the exciting developments around Sapa which reflects its boom as a tourist destination. The resident pets (cats and dogs) were also very friendly and made our stay more comfortable. Thank you once again to our hosts for a memorable stay!"

The location is very central and there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby. It is also perfect if you want to go up Fansipan. <br/>The bathroom was nice and modern, however the rest of the apartment needed doing up slightly. <br/>But overall, a great stay."

The restaurants and apartments with beautiful lights were magical and were the best spots for photos. The location was ideal—quiet yet close to local markets and restaurants, allowing easy exploration.

The price could be way better though, I felt I was overpaying. <br/>They accepted me to check out later and to modify my trip with one night even 2 days before our arrival, that was great.<br/>You have some basic things inside the house to make yourself a breakfast, super appreciated.<br/>For everyone who really wants to stay in Sa Pa city (although I recommend just stay in the villages as it is way more beautiful) this is a good choise if you are a family (for a couple it is too big)"

There was a kitchen, dining room and laundry service available in the public space. Breakfast is included in the price and unlike other places in Vietnam there are ingredients to prepare something for yourself. We even had fresh pineapples. There is also an option to leave luggage in the lobby, which is extremely useful if you want to hike in the neighborhood of SaPa. Overall, great place, highly recommended."

One of the highlights was how warmly we were welcomed despite arriving earlier than the standard check-in time, the staff accommodated us right away and even offered welcome food, major points for tired and slightly soggy travelers after a long trip.<br/>This place  is in a fantastic location just a short walk to Sapa Center and our unit has a clear view of the Sun Plaza. Even in the fog and rain, the misty views were stunning picture perfect.<br/>The room was simple but clean and cozy, perfect for relaxing after exploring. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay, and the atmosphere felt peaceful.<br/>Overall, Moc Studio gave us a comfortable, convenient, and laid back homey vibe  in Sapa. Highly recommended, especially for travelers who appreciate good service and a great location!"

The property is quiet and great to walk the area amongst beautiful scenery.  If you want to go into the main town it is easy and cheap to taxi in. We loved this place and highly recommend!"

The weather was very cold with lots of cloud with no visibility, not the best time of year to be in the valley of sapa unfortunately, lucky there was a heated blanket.  Place was clean. Food was good. Overall wrong time to be there"

Wooden house  With picturesque view clearly dip you in history , the details of the house amazed us , all house was made by Mai and her husband. And Mai is very friendly and nice person , always help us and support, also we ordered a dinner with wine , and it was very very delicious. We definitely recommend to stay in Chao Lao village instead of touristic SaPa. You will be amazed 100%!"

Mai was really proactive in helping to get to the house, which can be tricky on your own, but it was the best place to go on hikes for the day and coming back felt like a haven. If you are looking for a getaway from the agitation, to have a rest to the sounds of nature, here is your go."

Very responsive, friendly, and had good suggestions for my stay there. On a clear day the scenery is breathtaking, and one could make an entire day just walking around the surrounding area. The place itself is quite nice with a rustic/authentic feel to it, yet with modern amenities. Highly recommended!"

Hien coordinated several taxis and cooked the best food we ate during our time in and around Sapa. Sadly, we didn’t get to meet Mai and her family in person but Mai was still very supportive coordinating a motorbike rental and checking in on us from afar. If we stayed longer, we would have loved to also get to know Sô (sp?), the Hmong maid, and hear her  perspectives. We connected with other homestay guests during some of the shared meals and in passing. The home and garden are tranquil and inspiring (organic architecture). We loved eating fresh produce from the garden and being able to practice some spring roll assembly. Meow-Meow the kitten was hilarious as sidekick and Bo (sp?) dog is a chiller. There is a 4 km hike down the slope to Ta Van. Taxi to Ta Van~ 45 min, 450k VND depending on weather and road conditi"

A few insects in the room and bathroom but it's normal considering you're in the middle of nature. Other than that it was perfect. The staffs were super helpful and friendly. They even helped us with getting our rental motorbike and offered to store our luggages at Sapa Town after check-out for our convenience.  Thank you so much!"

The scenery matches the photos, the place was clean and the staff were always helpful. They even kept us up to date with weather conditions at least a week before we arrived. Opposite the bungalows is a taxi service which is easy to book through staff or Grab."

Sale and Cau were very welcoming and friendly, meeting us and helping us with our bags to where the taxi dropped us. The cabins were just like the photos, and it was great! We highly recommend the Bamboo Bar Restaurant near the cabins. We also availed of their trekking service, going around Ta Van. We were also able to purchase our Fansipan tickets here, saving us the trouble of lining up at Sun Plaza. 10/10 would recommend and book again."

The place offers breakfast and dinner at a really affordable price if you want, and they were always happy to help call a taxi for us — super convenient. You can choose to pay by card or cash, just let them know.<br/>The place was peaceful, and they let us use the clean shower and toilet before check-in, which was a nice touch if your room isn’t ready early. The only small downside was the dogs at night, but the latest we ever got back was around 9pm and luckily didn’t run into any.<br/>Would recommend this place if you’re heading to Sapa and prefer a peaceful stay — just keep in mind the taxi fare is about 250,000 VND per trip."

The internet speed was perfect for long zoom meetings. One of the highlights of our stay was the trekking tour we did with May and Sunmay. <br/>As a digital nomand I travel a lot, and we both felt like this place was unique and really worth it."

The place was clean and comfortable. The home cook with self grown rice was simple but delicious. Not to forget the trekking around villages for stunning rice fields panoramic view. Would like to come back again with better weather/ season."

Don’t take a Grab/Taxi there and use Mays suggested drivers (as the drive up the mountain gets technical and is dangerous for the wrong type of car). Go there for the nature. Super clean room and surroundings. Washing machine and drying were available on premise. Overall, a really great experience (but preferably not in Winter when it’s foggy and cold)."

          "comments": "Firstly, I want to say that May and her family are possibly the most genuinely friendly and helpful hosts I have ever met. They make you feel at home and part of their family from the very beginning. May speaks great English but prefers to communicate in writing through her son, Cao, who is super quick at answering any questions. He and his wife, Hoa, along with May’s husband Seeo, obviously play a big part in making their guests’ stays so memorable. May took us walking to a beautiful waterfall in the hills and was always ready to answer our many questions about their life. We ate a lovely breakfast prepared by Cao and a wonderful dinner which the whole family took part in making! The only reservation I would have for some guests is that this is a somewhat remote location and the journey there covers some rough ground! 14 km on mountain roads, is not the same as on paved tarmac. May organised a very skilful driver for us but it was still a little hairy! Thank you for a wonderful visit!"

The location is remote, and reaching it involves walking through rough and steep roads but the peaceful surroundings and fresh mountain air made it all worth it. The rooms were clean and cozy, with a spotless bathroom complete with toiletries, bidet, and hot shower. The food was delicious, and sharing meals with the family was a memorable experience. They also helped us book taxis, buy things we needed, and were super responsive in chat. Cao spoke great English and was very helpful! One thing to note: there are lots of barking dogs along the road which can be scary when walking to/from the house, but thankfully we weren’t bitten. Well, we just looked at it as  part of the adventure! Overall, a truly heartwarming and relaxing stay. We’d love to come back!"

We saw the color of the hill change over one day.<br/>Highly recommend if you want a true experience immersed with a Red Dao family."

We would come back in a heartbeat. Only thing to note is that it is a bit difficult to carry heavy bags to the location as taxi drivers cannot drive all the way to the property. We rented a scooter through the host as well, which made it super easy to drive to and from Sa Pa town."

The host was very responsive and she was really helpful when it came to local recommendations and check in/out. It is about 25 minutes outside from Sapa town so plan that when it comes to going into town. There is a local restaurants nearby that were all fantastic. Also with the environment the place is located in be prepared for lots of bugs and wildlife. Thank you for the stay it was much appreciated"

The room was beautiful with stunning views and clean amenities. During our stay we requested a cable car tour up to Fansipan, which the hosts booked for us and showed us a map to help the excursion be smooth and enjoyable! Communication from S Plus was quick, efficient, and friendly, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at S Plus and will be staying again in the future! <br/>The breakfast in the morning was a great start to the day and the staff were always happy to help with extras (i.e. extra towels, toilet paper, etc)."

They were also really helpful with our luggage. I only have great things to say about the room, host and all the staff in this place ! I also highly recommend booking an incense making tour with the suggestion from the host. (: and there is an amazing French restaurant near the air bnb called hmong sisters ta van. The cold cuts there are great!"

Dieu is very responsive and helpful in providing a lot of information, he always greets every guest in the restaurant, he says we are the first muslim guest in his homestay, and we are very glad to hear that. The bathroom in the room is very clean and still looks new, hot water is always there, and the blanket is very cozy for cold air. With that price, it is very proportional to the existing facilities. The most important thing is that the location is very close to sun plaza station and moana. The breakfast at the restaurant is also very cheap and delicious. Nice Dieu and crew"

They also booked my hiking and fansipan tours straight away, which made it easy for me. Not to mention I made some new friends staying there which was an added bonus. So do yourself a favor and stay here when visiting Sapa."

Had to sleep with our coats on one of the nights. There were stairs to get to the accommodation but these were absolutely fine and easily accessible. <br/>The location is a 2 minute walk from the centre of Sa Pa which was lovely and the place was generally very clean. The showers were good - Okay pressure but hot water was always guaranteed! <br/>Definitely would stay again if we go back in the summer but would not recommend for the winter months."

The room was as described but what really stood out to me was the energy of the owners. They radiate an aura of sympathy. The bar in front offers creative drinks as well as local craft beer and wine. It's a good place to meet people to talk to. When I come back to Sa Pa this is the place to stay!"

They allowed us early check-in and room was also clean before our arrival early in the morning. They have a nice tea/coffee area in the first floor with some books and games. Overall loved the place. The swimming pool was not functional during our stay but we never needed it. the bar next to it was peaceful. The name aptly describes"

The hosts were very accommodating and friendly, like you’ve been friends with them for a long time. The place was really nice and clean. The laid-back bar was a great addition to the stay since it’s quiet and serves great local wine. The stay made my Sapa trip memorable. Kudos to Yên, Chi, and Ánh! They were really great hosts! 🫶🏼"

A bit of an inconvenient location as the drive up to the place is rocky, bumpy, muddy, and scarily foggy at night. Bugs around the house and in bed and nothing really to prevent the bugs and the place wasn’t fully enclosed. Very lovely for the price though."

The journey takes you across the village path. It was different and great experience . Totally unforgettable views. The place is literally as its name little house by the rocky mountains. Great sight from the window panel and beautiful nature. Don't be suprised by all the nature surrounding you creating sounds and appearing by its their home anyway we are the guest. The smart tv is a suprised for me cause I didn't see it in the listing which is a great entertainment add up too. The weighted blanket is super amazing to sleep into after a long journey. Totally recommended !"

The couple downsides were the location was that it is remote and away from the main attractions, Sa Pa and restaurants. Harder to get taxi/grabs because the road is pretty bumpy/bad to navigate as you'll find out. Secondly, the bathroom has gaps which allows a lot of insects in and the hut is small and doesn't feel as luxurious as other huts on the resort. Hosts were very helpful and have a small menu for breakfast and dinner with veggie options. Thank you for letting us stay"

It's also a bit far from the city center, so it's not ideal for those with a packed itinerary. But for a relaxing getaway, especially for honeymooners, this place is perfect! The view is stunning, and the adorable host dog stole our hearts (tip: bring dog treats for instant friendliness)."

Je moet er wel rekening mee houden dat er insecten of kleine beestjes aanwezig kunnen zijn. Het huisje is rustig gelegen op 20 min van Sa Pa. Een taxirit kost 200 000 VND. De weg ernaartoe is hobbelig maar doenbaar. De hosts waren super vriendelijk! Het avondeten in het restaurant was heerlijk. Ze hebben speciaal voor ons vroeg in de ochtend ontbijt voorzien, omdat we extra vroeg moesten vertrekken voor een wandeltocht. Ze waren super flexibel en hebben ons een geweldige tijd bezorgd!"

It is nice to sleep to see the stars at night but if there is curtain it would be nice to sleep with dark room during the day and won’t feel hot. Nonetheless i still love the stay overall :)"

My bed was comfortable and cozy, bathroom clean and so many places to relax, read, admire stunning views. An absolute must: sit down to a family dinner with Thanh and Chang, and book your Sapa Trek through their recommended guide. One of my favourite experiences abroad ever."

The house was super comfortable, and every evening we enjoyed a cozy fire in the fireplace. The animals around the place were adorable, and the food was amazing – especially dinner, probably the best Vietnamese food I've ever had! What made it even more special were the little touches, like a warm tea after dinner. They really pay attention to the small things. Highly recommended!"

The two hosts were especially generous—they even prepared breakfast for me, which was absolutely delicious.<br/>The room was very clean and quiet, making for a peaceful and comfortable stay. The living room had stylish decor and was a great spot to relax and refresh. The hosts also introduced me to a local trekking guide, who was fantastic and helped make the experience even more memorable.<br/>The trek was quite long and physically demanding—it took over half a day—so I’d recommend being prepared in terms of stamina. That said, the hosts kindly lent me rubber boots, so I didn’t have to worry about getting my shoes or feet dirty. Along the way, I was able to meet and interact with people from various ethnic communities, which was a deeply meaningful and rare experience.<br/>After returning from the trek, I was offered a shower, which"

Fijne plek om te verblijven! <br/>Ook het personeel is erg vriendelijk en meedenkend. Het is mogelijk een scooter bij hun te huren, ook denken ze mee met vervoer naar andere plekken zoals terug naar Hanoi. <br/>Bij hun restaurant zijn er veel verschillende dingen te kiezen om te eten en drinken. <br/>We voelden ons erg welkom en zouden hier zeker terug komen!

The village, Ta Van, was the perfect place to stay to experience the picturesque mountains of Sapa and is home to the best restaurants, cafes and bars with incredible views within a 5 minute walk from the Airbnb. The hosts were so so kind and helped us book taxis and a hike and prepared delicious family meals for all the guests. We definitely recommend staying here if you come to Sapa, felt like a home away from home!"

A Red Dzao maam will be your guide, she will share the lifestyle , culture of her ethnicity or other interesting stories to you. It’s a very unique and unforgettable experience. Thanh’s house is very beautiful and I love the style. We’ve dinner together and it was excellent, i’m sad that I could not taste it anymore. Anyway, we had a very good time in Thanh’s homestay. I’m sure I will miss it a lot. (Btw: Thanh’s wife is very pretty )"

They helped us organise taxis to and from Sapa, a great local guide for a trek and the local laundry service. Chang’s food was incredible and the best food we have had in Vietnam. The homestay was impeccably cleaned multiple times a day, meaning that sharing a bathroom with others was no problem at all. The location is excellent, the village has loads of great restaurants and cafes - MUCH better than Sapa town. We felt right at home and would love to stay again if we come back to Sapa in the future."

Mẩy is an exceptionally gracious host—every meal was delicious and made with fresh, local ingredients. Her son, Cáo, was incredibly helpful with communication before and during our visit, making everything smooth and easy.<br/>Though it’s off the beaten track, that’s exactly what made it the perfect retreat. The peaceful setting, far from tourist crowds, gave our kids a chance to explore nature, spot wildlife, and meet friendly farm animals. It was restful, beautiful, and full of charm.  Skeptical of leaving behind their screens when we came, after three nights here, our kids didn’t want to leave when it was time!<br/>What made the experience even more special was learning about the Dao minority, to which Mẩy and her family belong. Their warmth and connection to the land gave us a deeper appreciation for the culture of this region."

They are very friendly and often took the initiative to find out about our plans, so that they can accommodate to us.<br/>The location is very peaceful and a great getaway into the village! May recommended many activities for us to do, such as trekking, motorbike tour, climbing fansipan mountain (all guided by her or Cao), so you won’t have to stress too much about finding local guides!<br/>The Airbnb is located at least 30min away from sapa town by car, and there’s only two taxi drivers who are skilled enough to drive through the bumpy terrain of the villages to get to the Airbnb! May and Cao are very quick to contact them whenever we needed the transport.<br/>The food prepared by May and her family is extremely delicious too! Lots of fresh vegetables and fruits :)<br/>I did not have trouble communicating with May and Cao as they can speak English well!<br/>Overall I highly recommend this airbnb, I hope to come back one day!"

We loved everything about our stay - from our bungalow (which was very clean and comfortable), to the food (so delicious), and most of all, to May, Cao, and the entire family for welcoming us with such open arms. We were really looking forward to this leg of our trip to Vietnam and it was beyond our expectations. Simply perfect. Staying here is our highlight and a must if you’re in the region! <br/>We highly recommend doing the trek, and enjoying the home cooked meals (with other visitors if you’re lucky) - such nice moments!"

May was not only generous with the food servings (such yummy food!!) but also with her time and patience. She answered my million questions with so much patience and always with a smile. My kids and I enjoyed being her guests immensely and felt immediately very welcome. The surrounding area is so gorgeous and the bungalow itself was very nice and comfortable. We went on a hike in the mountains and bamboo forest, the views were breathtaking and we even stopped at a waterfall and were able to jump in for a swim. The hike was not so easy especially after the rain, but May was attentive and made sure we were okay. At night we had the herbal bath and that too was a lovely experience. We will cherish our time with May, her family and the dogs. Thank you, lovely family!"

Een echte aanrader (bij mooi weer). Prachtige vergezichten en s middags eten bij locals (lekker). Ook het medicinaal kruidenbad was een ervaring. May was een zeer goede gastvrouw. Ze doet je onmiddellijk thuis voelen. Het eten (zowel ontbijt, lunch als diner) is zeer lekker (bedankt aan May’s schoondochter). Wij hebben ontzettend genoten van ons verblijf."

You can see the mountain and the fields.<br/>For a large group like us, the place was perfect, we avoided the hustle and  bustle of Sapa square.<br/>Our host (Jenny) was exceptional.  She consistently provides high level of kindness and helpfulness. She arranged our sleeper bus from Hanoi to Sapa, find a limousine for us and consistently provide us with assistance.  She’s sweet and very friendly. <br/>The place is highly recommended to guest who wants a peaceful and comfort of a home."

Lots of great coffee places and cafes around. So location a 10! <br/>The host is actually amazing, helped us a lot with e.g. renting a scooter & taxi and was soooo quick in responsive. Really nice! 😊 <br/>They had kittens at the garden (too cute!) & the whole ‘common area’ was extremely beautiful. Surrounded by green and everything is made from wood :)<br/>The reason we’re not giving five stars is because we thought price-wise it was quite expensive for the house you get. The mattress was on the ground, and there was construction very early in the morning."

The location is great, we initially thought it would be closer to Sa Pa City but in the end, we were so happy about the location (it’s a 30 minutes drive from Sa Pa City). The village is lovely with plenty of beautiful restaurants around where you can just chill and relax. The home is on the same property as a cafe/restaurant that has a cozy vibe with kind cats and dogs. The staff and hosts were amazing, helped us out a bunch (laundry, taxi and more).<br/>Were we to come back, we would most likely book this place again."

The village is amazing (sooo much better than Sapa) and it offers everything you need — beautiful nature and views, lots of trekking trails, there are also restaurants, bars, shops and even a good spa. The garden in front of the house and the decoration really stood out. Truc and Thi Sen were very responsive and helped us with everything we needed.<br/>Breakfasts were ok (big portions, but not as great in taste as we were used to in Vietnam). On the downside, I think the cabin could use more storage space — the overall aesthetic suffers when our things are scattered on the floor. Also, unfortunately, the bungalow area wasn’t very peaceful — we were often woken up in the morning by construction noises, drilling, and so on."

Ta Van was peaceful and quiet it felt rural but still very close to Sapa which we enjoyed checking out for day trips. The bungalow has amazing mountain views and is at the base of where many of the walks and treks start. Water was hot, bathroom was clean, bed had an electric blanket which was perfect. Highlight of our stay was the warm hospitality of the cafe/restaurant that is next door to the bungalow ‘Sa Moc’ delicious food and drink, very welcoming! The host and Sen were quick to respond and very helpful with booking activities and taking care of any queries we had. Would recommend to friends 100%"

The amazing surroundings paired with the beautiful bungalow was something I won’t forget. <br/>The location is 20 minutes taxi from sapa town but staying a little bit further away was actually so much nicer. The village offers restaurants, drinks and plenty of cute animals. <br/>The food at Truc’s was also good, very generous portions. <br/>Thank you, will be recommending to many other travellers heading to Sapa."

The surroundings are beautiful, it’s so cozy and pretty, there are cozy lights in the night. It’s peaceful generally but there was a lot of construction work going on around the place when we stayed during Christmas so was a bit loud.<br/>Food and coffee is good and definitely try the homemade wines. The only thing was that the rest of the staff felt a bit unwelcoming and unhelpful, only nice when around the owner. Overall would recommend!"

If you're looking to get away from it all, but still have access to some sightseeing, bars and restaurants, this is the place to go. Truc is an incredible host; proactive in communication and replies within minutes of any questions asked. Truc is also super helpful and was able to arrange a scooter during my stay as well as a driver for an evening out and to take me to the bus station.<br/>I am going bak to Vietnam and this place is on the top of my list!"

The village is off the main road and the homestay is at the end of the village,  a very tranquil place.   You will be surrounded by Red Dao language and culture.  Home cooked meals are fantastic.   Also don't miss the motorbike and walking tours.  I will certainly be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"

Wir haben eine Halbtags-Wanderung mit May gebucht und keinen Cent bereut. Außerdem hat das Frühstück alle Erwartungen übertroffen. Ich würde den Aufenthalt bei May nur empfehlen! Dankeschön May!"

Loi was proactive, reactive and flexible. The breakfast was delicious. The location of the hotel was great. We like so much that we extended our stay of two nights. We definitely recommend for a stay in Sa Pa."

They provide a free brekky & have free fruit & tea for the guests. The staff here are so so helpful & friendly. The room was so clean & tidy, great bathroom & shower! A very quiet area with lots around. A great place for people who work remotely as there are lots of tables & chairs with a quiet working space & power points! Defs recommend this place!!!!"

Not to mention the bed is extremely comfortable, not the typical hard bed that is common in Vietnam. You can tell they use quality bed sheets, soap<br/> and there's always running hot water. They even have good options for breakfast. It's only a 5 minute walk to the Sapa Station and center, the only downside is the hill back up but not bad. There's marts along the way and few restaurants. Overall highly recommend here!"

It’s clean, comfortable (the bed/pillows were the BEST), the breakfast is tasty, the host is responsive and attentive and kind. The location is great as well, as it’s a bit secluded but just a 9 min walk to the city centre. I cannot think of any complaints whatsoever. I strongly recommend this place if you’re looking to relax while exploring Sapa! Thanks for everything, specially for your patience and kindness."

It was a pretty cheap airbnb but I would pay for a better apartment next time as this room felt dirty and unsafe to live in. Owner was super nice and friendly though. Would recommend staying here if you are not afraid of insects."

The hosts were really sweet. They let us leave our bags after checkout, and even let us shower before heading out. <br/>Would totally recommend for a chill, stress-free stay in Sapa!"

Beside it is The Mist where you can get coffee and breakfast. The room is clean and the bed is big, even has a heater since Sapa is cold when we were there. Overall, I loved our stay. <br/>Too bad we were not able to spend the first night there because of my poor scheduling (we booked 2 nights). I would have liked to enjoy what the bar has to offer. Did I mention there is a bar just right outside our room? Will definitely come back and this place is super recommended!"

We got the middle room which had the bar right outside so coming back in the evening, you could enjoy a drink right before going to bed! The owners were mindful enough to keep the music at a comfortable level too so it wouldn’t affect guests even if you’re just resting in the room. About the location, it was far enough from the city centre for a peaceful night of sleep, but close enough on foot to plenty of food places & even the Sapa station to Fansipan. The hosts helped us with pretty much all questions we had as well & even with a bike rental 🤣 All in all, top notch hosting & couldn’t recommend this listing more for a pleasant stay in Sapa!"

Yen 같은 경우 늦은 귀가에도 항상 친절히 반겨줍니다. 그리고 숙소 건물 바로 옆에 바도 운영되는데 이곳이 사파의 낭만을 끌어올리는데 최고였어요. 바텐더가 만들어주는 칵테일 한잔과 yen의 따뜻한 마음과 포그 사파 속 낭만을 느껴보시려면 한번 묵어보시겠어요?<br/>단점<br/>1. 오르막길이 많음. 캐리어 같은 경우는 이동이 힘들 수 있으나 그랩이 숙소 초입구까지는 오니까 커버가능. 단 숙소입구에서 숙소까지는 힘 좀 써야하나 고생 끝에 낙이온다는 것을 절실히 느낄 수 있음. (체크아웃 땐 yen 도와줌)<br/>2. 난방시설(침대 전기매트, 전기히터)가 있어 잠자는데는 무리가 없지만 씻고 나온 직후에는 잠시 추움. 전기히터가 좀 더 고성능으로 교체된다면 단점이 보완 될 듯 함.<br/>장단점이 분명한 곳이었지만 여행을 마치고 돌아봤을 때 편히 묵었던 호텔들보다 기억에 많이 남는 곳이에요. 사실 단지 숙박만을 위한 선택지였는데 호스트yen 덕분에 사람의 따스함을 느꼈고,  사파를 보다 더 잘 이해할 수 있어서 참 행복했네요. 캠핑(글램핑) 좋아하시는 분이라면 적극 추천하는 곳입니다!! <br/>(Yen의 한국어사용은 사랑스럽구요❤️"

The location and views are insanely beautiful. Food is good and we also loved the trekking tour with a local that Jack arranged for us. Definitely recommend if you want to stay outside the touristy city. It is also possible to rent a motor cycle and explore the area yourself."

The views from the top balcony stole our hearts as well as the cute puppy dogs! We felt very heard by all the staff and even when we asked to swap rooms the second day (because the bathroom fan wasn’t working), it was a swift and easy process. Such a beautiful family we would definitely recommend staying here. <br/>Thank you 🥹🧡"

It’s around 30 mins drive from the Sapa town but if you can drive or rent a car shouldn’t be any issue to go around. Rental is available too and pretty good place to stay. You can hike near by waterfall as well if you’re adventurous. Hope to go back if there is a chance."

Wir fanden das allerdings super, da es genug zu erleben in dem kleinen Ort selbst gab. Außerdem konnten wir super stressfrei über die Unterkunft günstig einen Scooter buchen, wodurch man die Gegend erkunden konnte. <br/>Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und schön eingerichtet. Außerdem gab es immer jemanden vor Ort, falls man Hilfe brauchte oder man konnte Pavi direkt schreiben. <br/>Absolut empfehlenswert auch für mehrere Tage! 😊"

The host is very accommodating and friendly, check in was very smooth even at 10pm. He offers trekking services at a good price, which we would consider if it could fit in our itinerary. He has a driver that can bring you anywhere. Hailing grab is easy too! I’ve never once had difficulty even with such a location.<br/>I missed breakfast timing once, but Pavi still brought the food to our room when he didn’t have to. I wasn’t the best patron, and still, wonderful service all round. The fried spring rolls is a must order!<br/>A 10min straight walk along the road to Sapa Eco Villas where they offer spa+herbal services for cheap. Another scenic 10mins and it’s a really big supermarket called Thach Son. Another 5mins and you’re at Sailing Cafe! <br/>The house is decent, but the view, service, and the cats/small dogs in the area will win your heart! I promise!"

Our highlight was playing with the beautiful and friendly dogs. 🥰 Please note it is not close to amenities or restaurants so if you don’t have a motorbike, you are restricted to only eating at the homestay. The restaurant food is fine but pretty overpriced. Unfortunately it was quite hot and humid during our stay and the air conditioner in our room did not work effectively. The host gave us a fan but basically said it’s working fine and it’s just an old system when the air coming out was clearly not cool air…<br/>It would have been nice to have a water refill station in the room since there was no way to buy more water without going into town. <br/>Overall a nice place to consider staying at. Comfortable bed and nice hot shower!"

Die außergewöhnliche Gastfreundschaft und das harmonische Zusammenleben mit der Natur und den süßen Hunden haben unseren Aufenthalt unvergesslich gemacht. Von der Ankunft bis zur Abreise war alles perfekt. Wir konnten sogar nach Absprache früher einchecken. Die Gastgeber sind unglaublich freundlich und haben uns das Gefühl gegeben, wie zu Hause zu sein. Das Essen ist unglaublich lecker und wird jeden Abend frisch zubereitet. Wir hatten hier die wahrscheinlich besten Frühlingsrollen unserer Reise. Die Umgebung ist atemberaubend und bietet eine Oase der Ruhe und Erholung. Es gibt viele Wandermöglichkeiten in der Nähe. Der Gastgeber hat uns viele Tipps und Empfehlungen gegeben. Wir können diese Unterkunft wärmstens empfehlen und werden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen."

Der Ausblick ist wirklich beruhigend und der schönste von allen Homestays und Hotels, die wir gesehen hatten. Wir verbrachten hier 5 Nächte und waren sehr froh, dass es etwas weiter abseits war und wir den Blick und die Ruhe genießen konnten. Es werden verschiedene Trekking Touren angeboten. Die Zimmer waren einfach und ausreichend. Wir werden die Gastgeber, den Ort und die Hunde in positiver Erinnerung behalten."

Gracias."

The streets have no names so airbnb hasn’t figured this one out. The location is stunning and very peaceful away from the noise of Sapa which is far larger than I expected. Pavi is a terrific host and I highly recommend his place"

You don’t need to visit the fake Cat Cat village if you’re already staying in a real village.<br/>The chef was great, he didn’t know english but that wasn’t a big issue.

The views were incredible and the garden around the house was lovely! <br/>One thing to note for anyone considering staying here is that it is a 30-45 min drive from town - the roads are very rough from the recent typhoon. Other than that, this place was perfect :)<br/>Thankyou again for all your help Huyen with finding taxis for our group of six and to Sung for his help with our suitcases."

The housekeeper was also super friendly and helpful and a great cook. The rain caused by the typhoon had us stay inside but we still had a good time. Would love to come again to explore the beautiful mountain surroundings for hiking. All in all an accommodation to recommend!"

The location, although a little hard to get to due to its distance from Sapa Town and the rough roads, is beautiful and serene. Huyen is able to arrange a taxi to get you to and fro Sapa Town, which helped us out tremendously. <br/>The house also has a housekeeper that can prepare meals for you, something that we found convenient as it takes 30 minutes to get to town. <br/>Overall, it was a pleasant stay."

We did find the house a bit cold though - there is a fireplace downstairs, and it was cosy and nice to sit there and play boardgames and talk. Upstairs, we had electric heaters. The house is big, though, so we still felt cold while not under the covers or in front of the fire place. <br/>Huyen is always quick to answer any questions and comunicates clearly. Mr Song made us very nice meals and kept the house tidy and clean. <br/>I would absolutely love to come back during spring, summer or autumn to really take advantage of the house and it's amazing surroundings."

The house is so spacious, decorated well, and cozy. We are glad we chose to rent two motorbikes and drive separately with our bags since you have to make it up the mountain and some areas are rocky. It was a beautiful drive. Definitely pack what you want to drink/eat if you don't want to go back to town. There's some small shops, not too far by motorbike, that have beer and the basics. If you want to relax, Huyen can also help you find a taxi. The housekeeper is so kind and can help to cook, clean, etc. We felt that we wanted to be alone and he completely gave us our own privacy, but it was good to know he was available if we needed him. Thank you so much again 🙏🏼"

We had two meals with the family which were possibly the best we’ve had in Vietnam. <br/>We got to learn a little about Hmong culture; their food and language is so different to Vietnamese and definitely worth finding out about. Our room was so cozy and had a much-appreciated mosquito net. The views are just breathtaking, and Ya was so kind and generous. Thank you so much, we hope we can come back!"

It is a very quiet place in the rice fields, among other Hmong families. You can get a glimpse into the everyday life of this indigenous group of people :)<br/>It’s important to mention that this stay is not for everyone. It is not far from a main road, but the walk is very steep (do not try riding up it with an automatic scooter, you need at least a semi if you want to use a bike). If you are someone who has physical limitations, I would consider whether this is a good fit for you. In the summer this place was a little too hot for me as there is no fan and few windows. I did mention this to the host, however, and she accepted my feedback very graciously, so I believe future guests may have a fan. Double check with the host 😉<br/>It was a unique and beautiful stay, and I would recommend it to adventurous and culturally curious souls :) best of luck Ya!"

Their very beautifully renovated homestay ended up being the perfect place for my partner & I to comfortably recharge for a few days in the middle of our busy 2 months. It’s a very cute artsy space with adorable cats & dogs to keep company, and in a nice area with accessible food options as well as trekking tours. Their stewed beef noodles & salted coffee were also delicious!! Wish we could’ve stayed a bit longer and tried some of their workshops :’)<br/>Thank you! Hope to meet again <3"

From the moment we arrived, they made us feel so welcome, like we were part of their family. Their kindness and hospitality truly made our experience unforgettable.<br/>One of the highlights of our stay was the delicious beef noodles—hands down some of the best we’ve ever had! <br/>We also absolutely loved spending time with their adorable pets, who added so much joy to our days. Whether it was playful moments or just the comforting presence of furry friends, they made the homestay feel even more like home.<br/>Another unforgettable experience was the indigo dyeing class. Learning about the traditional techniques and getting hands-on with the dyeing process was both fascinating and fun. Luna shared her knowledge with so much passion, making the workshop an incredibly special and immersive experience.<br/>Everything about Blue Bird Homestay was perfect!"

Breakfast set cooked by host was delicious at just 60k. <br/>Recommended by the host for a walking tour, we took it up and saw so many scenic views 😍<br/>The only downside is a flight of 30m stairs you have to climb to get to the main town.<br/>Other than that, highly recommended 5 star Airbnb 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

Within walking distance of some nice restaurants and cafés. Lo is super friendly, helpful, and very responsive. He invited us to stay with his family for dinner. The view over the rice fields is beautiful, and it's very quiet at night. There is a heated mattress since it can get quite cold at night in February."

No hand soap but did provide sachets of body wash and shampoo which was helpful since we arrived without our luggage. <br/>Stored our luggage when it arrived and for a few hours on our final day, very responsive when we arrived with flexible check in (we arrived at 3 instead of our estimated 4-5pm). <br/>It was noisier than expected since there were a group of rowdy boys in the home stay next door which we weren’t expecting. Whilst the bungalow was private there were buildings above and not far below and you could see some people in the rice fields. Thought it would be more secluded. <br/>Generally would recommend since it was out of sapa town and gave us a chance to try local food and see another village in the surrounding area. <br/>Lo and his family were all lovely and very welcoming."

Depending on the vehicle, it can get you pretty close, only then you'd understand that the price of the taxi is worth it. The views were stunning, I kid you not.<br/>We came during planting season, so instead of the green rice field in the picture, it was full of water. This was so nice especially during the full moon. The reflection of the moon as you sit outside was enchanting. The room is simple, it's a clean comfy bed and a hot shower (and a nice sink). Two sides of the room was all glass, so you could chill on the bed and be mesmerized by the view of the mountains in front or the rice field/pond on the side, it was amazing. Really worth the money on this one. Hot shower did not come on at first but Lo responded immediately (not even 10mins) and reset the hot shower and it worked like a charm. Lo was very helpful and the people of Ta Van are nothing but lovely. We really enjoyed our experience"

Our first night the shower head became detached from its base. Thanks to good communication with the caretaker and staff, it was fixed the following day. The inclined slope up to the quarters (about 70 meters/75 yards) had some algae covering which could have been treacherous when wet. The staff worked on scraping it and sprinkling what appeared to be salt; although care was still necessary to avoid a fall or slip.<br/>The room was small. While totally adequate for 1 person, it was a bit tight for 2 for more than a few days. Shelving was limited; closet space nonexistent, so gear had to be arranged on the floor. A short distance away were several superb restaurants, 2 of which provided us with delicious meals.<br/>While accommodations were adequate (comfortable, clean and conveniently located), if I were to visit Sapa again, I would look into renting another place."

They also have a laundry service.

Zum Glück konnte mein Freund sie alle entfernen und hatte das Bett gründlich untersucht!<br/>Leider hatten wir in unserem Schlafbereich in der oberen Ecke Schimmel entdeckt, was ich dem Besitzer am nächsten Morgen via Chat mitgeteilt hatte und hoffe, dass er es für die nächsten Besucher entfernt!<br/>Sonst war die Unterkunft in Ordnung!"

The meals were delicious and the house is so beautiful. We spent a day relaxing by the pool and another day trekking. It rained a lot the day we were trekking so Sang and her husband bought us rain boots and ponchos. We could not recommend her enough, they are so good!!! I wish we could stay longer!"

It’s easy enough to find a driver to get to the place but getting somewhere from the place itself was a little challenging. Thankfully, the staff will assist you in calling for a taxi. Only regret for booking this stay is that I didn’t book for longer!"

          "comments": "The cabin itself was nice, nothing to shout about but the surroundings were super tranquil. Loved the greeneries lining the pathways, with panoramic views overlooking the paddy fields. There were some stairs leading up to the cabin, where you get a nice balcony and a large garden surrounding it. At night it looks magical all lit up. Beware of insects though. I enjoyed chilling in the room with Netflix and walking around the area especially when the air is clear (no fog). <br/>I took the recommended taxi and as expected the ride was rough (took about 20-30 min from Sapa town). For meals, they didn’t have halal options but I brought my own food & snacks and ordered white rice and omelette from their kitchen. They were kind enough to accommodate my requests. Breakfast was toasts with eggs and pancake (asian style) with syrup.<br/>Worth staying for a relaxing time, otherwise not much to do. Pool wasn’t clean enough to swim in."

This is by far worth it simply for the view and the surroundings of the ecology. The staff is incredible as well. They were so attentive and friendly.  Breakfast was included and it was excellent! We will be returning here the next time we are in Vietnam."

The staff were so friendly and bent over backwards to make our stay memorable. Great to be in a small family lodge with only a few bungalows  compared to the large resorts surrounding SaPa. The rooms are relatively basic but are very comfy and are built and decorated beautifully in the traditional styles. Location is peaceful away from the main town but we never had a problem getting a Grab the 10-15 mins into town. It was lovely watching the rice farmers at work and falling asleep to the sound of nature."

We celebrated our honeymoon here and it was very memorable even though we didn’t get to enjoy the sun, the views were still wonderful when the fog got clearer. At night it was lightly raining and very peaceful to fall asleep to. The staff were very professional and wonderful. The kitchen also cooked delicious meals and breakfast for us.

If you eat at the accommodation, the food is very fresh and they cook it for you whenever you would like as long as you give them notice. <br/>The room was traditional and no AC but at the time of year we visited we found this ok. The staff came round and cleaned the  bathroom and refreshed towels everyday. <br/>We would highly recommend this accommodation if you would like to wake up to amazing views and stay out of the busyness of the main town but still be in a short distance to Grab in."

The food was perfect with fresh ingredients from the farm. The staff were so friendly and helped us so much. They were so helpful with our daughter and loved playing with her. They let her feed their koi fish in their pond and play with their animals.<br/>Being a little bit away from central Sa Pa there are motorcycles to hire 500m walk up the road.<br/>If you aren’t keen to ride, Khanh was ordering grab taxis for people.<br/>We will definitely come back here or refer to our friends.<br/>We highly recommend this location!"

Their staff is amazing, especially Nam, along with the ladies in the kitchen and housekeeping. The front desk gentleman is also extremely personable and will provide his expert opinion to tour the area. The owners Khanh, and his wife are very hospitable, and this is a definite must-stay for Sapa and visiting Fanispan and other attractions, shops, and villages. I would not stay anywhere else upon my return to Sapa. This felt like family, and I was extremely welcomed and felt great about the experience. The restaurant serves delicious food, and they were very accommodating in preparing me breakfast for some of my early morning activities even before the kitchen officially opened. Five Star service, without a doubt!!! Please stay here for a visit, and you will not be disappointed."

The food was the best we had in Vietnam and the complementary breakfast was so convenient. The staff consists of the nicest humans we have honestly ever met and they made us feel like we were at home. Their hospitality is something we have never experienced before. There are more than enough activities available including swimming in their pool, getting a massage on the property, taking a cooking class and trekking tours. The taxi from SaPa is 200k Vietnamese Dong and the staff will call it for you whenever you would like to leave the property. By the end of the trip we wanted to stay at the Eco Palms forever. This was genuinely the best experience we’ve had and I couldn’t recommend it more."

Even though we arrived at 2am, the on-site staff greeted us warmly and made check-in a breeze. A big heartfelt thank you to the lovely Sumy—she went above and beyond to help us with everything from Fansipan tickets, local guide arrangements, to recommending massage spots. Her kindness and care made our trip extra special. The staff were always ready to help, even giving us a heads-up about bugs in the area, which is to be expected since we were in the mountains. The taxi service tied to the stay made getting to and from the town centre effortless throughout the trip. We also loved the free breakfast, delicious Vietnamese coffee, and the sweet dogs that kept us company each morning. It was such a memorable stay—we’re so grateful and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful mountain retreat."

          "comments": "TLDR; highly recommended if you need a retreat spot/ romantic getaway. Not the most ideal for solo travelers, or those that want good access to Sapa Town.<br/>Initially booked for a three night stay - but cut it to one night since the roads and lights towards the place wasn't as developed to our liking - it was rocky, about 30-40 mins by car, and would be inconvenient for when we stayed out late in Sapa Town. HOWEVER, the host did try to alleviate the blow on the remote location by offering to book a car for us if Grabs were difficult to find. Maybe until the infrastructure is more solid, we'd be very happy for a return. <br/>BUT - if you're keen to make this your retreat away from the noise, and don't have to go into Sapa Town that often, I would highly recommend this place. It has it's own pool, and despite the distance - WiFi, running water and heating were are superb. Not to mention a good selection of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner if you get hungry. Highly recommend the hotpot."

Dejligt tæt på naturen og fantastisk sød vært med gode lokale anbefalinger- vi var med guiden Tam, som tog os på en 4 timers tur ud i rismarkerne. Det var virkelig en god oplevelse!<br/>Hvis du vil bo tæt på byen, så er dette måske lidt langt væk - især fordi vejen dertil er meget svær. Vi tog taxi derhen, som var anbefalet af vært, hvilket var super fint, men det tog alligevel en halv time og ville på ingen måde anbefale at tage scooter selv.<br/>Desuden var der på ingen måde koldt, da de havde varmeblæser, varme i sengetæpperne og en varmeblæser på badeværelset 🫶<br/>Tak for denne gang!"

We came right after the typhoon so they were still fixing the roads. It was a bit scary coming up the mountain in our arranged car ride recommended from the host (they also have Grab in Sapa for comparable prices), but we came so late and the drivers were very knowledgeable of the roads so we felt a bit safer. The owners were nice, they greeted us and checked us in at 12am! The owner’s dogs and cat were one of the best parts! They also serve free breakfast which was delicious. You have the occasional spider or insects, but it was perfectly fine. Overall, it was a fantastic stay in Sapa and really appreciate the hosts and their hard work!"

Moreover, lots of people pass this room to see the view and the glass walls don’t ensure much privacy. Lastly, if you are thinking of renting motorbike, be wary the roads are very rocky and difficult in one section .    Overall we loved the cabin though- very clean and beautiful views-  thank you Lo"

The rice on the terrace was just being planted so it wasn't green yet, so the view would probably be nicer in a month other than May. The place was slightly hard to find and hard to get to (lots of walking up and down steep hills), but the upshot is that it's very peaceful, with no cars going by."

It’s the perfect spot to relax, go hiking, and take in the natural beauty of the Sapa.<br/>The road to get there is a bit tricky and steep, but totally worth it once you arrive! There are small restaurants and cafés within walking distance, and it takes about 25–30 minutes by taxi to reach Sapa town.<br/>Lo was incredibly kind, helpful, and responded quickly to all our messages. We felt very welcome and we’d love to come back again!"

Location is private and peaceful alrhough it’s a hit hard to reach by taxi and a long way from the Sapa town center but if you’re into the peace and quiet and you want to relax, it’s the perfect place. There’s lots of restaurants and places to see nearby too. <br/>Room is just right for 2 people and looks exactly how it is in pictures. Lo and the care taker are very friendly and responsive, they just live next door so they can assist in everything. They are flexible on the check in and out too. <br/>Overall i had a great stay at this place and definitely recommended ! ❤️"

Surrounded by lush greenery and peaceful mountains, this retreat blends comfort, sustainability, and authentic Vietnamese hospitality.

Thi Houng went above and beyond to make our stay memorable—sharing local tips and helping plan nearby adventures. Her genuine care truly stands out. If you’re looking to unwind, connect with nature, and enjoy a touch of luxury, this is the place. Perfect for couples, solo travelers, or anyone seeking peace in Vietnam’s mountains."

I like how peaceful the place is but still near along the sapa town center, it is really accessible and easy to locate. Quang is so accommodating and hospitable, a really nice host. He responds fast to our queries. If we ever travel to Sa Pa again, we will for sure book this place again."

The location is excellent — very close to the church and in a quiet area, yet just a short and easy walk to the town center. <br/>Quang was very kind and helpful throughout our stay. Overall, a lovely experience!"

But I LOVED the heated bed which was a major plus in my book.  Quang was extremely hospitable as I was able to leave my big bag with him for a couple of days while trekking in the village and was always responsive. He even helped me find a place after to keep my bags several more hours for free as he was closed for the evening.  2min walk to Sapa station and church and very conveniently located.  Great stay for me."

Restaurants, Cafés, Geschäfte, Seilbahn, alles sehe gut zu erreichen. <br/>Während meines Aufenthalts war es sehr kalt mit Nachts um die 5°C. Das Zimmer war entsprechend auch kalt. Es gibt zwar eine beheizbare Bettunterlage, aber der Raum bleibt trotzdem kalt. Auch das Badezimmer ist kalt und trocknet nach dem Duschen nicht richtig durch die Kälte. Für etwa 6min kann man heiß duschen, danach wird das Wasser kalt. <br/>Das Zimmer bietet wenig Stauraum, also eher was für Einzelpersonen oder Pärchen mit wenig Gepäck.<br/>Im Zimmer gibt es einen Wasserkocher, am ersten Tag bekommt man Handtücher, 2 kleine Wasserflaschen und Shampoo & Showergel. <br/>Um ruhig schlafen zu können empfehle ich Ohrenstöpsel."

Das ist ein sehr gemütliches Hotel ein Stück weiter oben am Berg. Das war eins der schönsten und nettesten Hotels, wo ich bisher war! Das Personal ist super lieb und gibt viele Tipps, aber nur wenn man sie auch haben möchte. Die Umgebung und der Ausblick über die Berge sind sehr schön und gut zum Wandern. Das Restaurant im Hotel und der Service sind super!"

The bed had heating available, linens were clean and smelt amazing too.<br/>The toilet was really unique, with rocks as part of the the whole look. As the room overlooks the river, there were a few harmless slugs that might appear at night but nothing much of a concern for me. Got to wash my clothes as well with their washing machine and dryer available.<br/>All the staff were really kind and helpful! They helped me to arrange a taxi to and fro Sapa Town pre and post check-out as Grab isn’t available in Sapa. The breakfast were delicious meals we could preselect the night before! There were also a lot of benches and even swings in the restaurant/entrance common area for a peaceful chill spot to read a book or stargaze to the sound of the river. <br/>Hosts were very proactive and even recommended local cafes/bars to visit and even accessible hiking spots. <br/>Would definitely love to come back again!"

Chambre avec des taches au sol, salle de bain pas très propres, eau chaude aléatoire et moisissure. Literie très dure. <br/>De plus la communication est très compliqué. Nous avons certes demander une arrivée plus tôt car nous arrivions avec un bus de nuit, on nous dit que ce sera peut être possible et qu’on nous tient au courant. Résultat on ne nous a rien dit, on est arrivée à 8h on nous a dit de repasser à 12h puis à 14h, pour une arrivée finalement à 15h. Même en ayant contacté l’hôte par message, nous avons eu une première réponse puis plus rien. <br/>Dépanne bien mais pour une nuit."

          "comments": "This is a beautiful stay in a traditional Hmong village. Mr.Chu is a great cook, and his wife was very kind as well. Please note that food by him is a separate cost that goes directly to him - so bring cash. There aren’t any restaurants in the area as it is a local village, so keep this in mind.  If you get hungry between meals, it might be wise to bring some snacks for yourself.<br/>The kids were very cute and friendly, and when I stayed, there were also a few Vietnamese volunteers who also spoke English, which made my stay even more special as they showed me around and explained the volunteer work they were doing in the village. <br/>The homestay itself is very clean and nice, I liked the design and ambience. Sometimes communication with the host was not always quick, but they provided an in depth message right upon booking which answered most of my questions. Thank you again and all the best 🙂"

To me, I felt like I was transported into the pages of a national geographic magazine. Amazing views, local life - chickens, pigs, dogs, ducks, water Buffalo, etc.  If you are wondering- the place has stone floors but is spotless. The walls are wooden slats but I never saw a ‘creature’ ie. mouse, etc. inside or outside. The shower is hot. Taxi will easily take you to Sapa if you want to go. Trekking is amazing with the host (my daughter was so excited because she got to see China). The food is AMAZING, plentiful and healthy. Great vegetarian options. The hosts are beautiful, welcoming people. Taxi service that was recommended was also super helpful. Stayed here with my 16 year old daughter and we both felt safe walking the street, hiking whether alone or together. This is a great community- nobody tries to sell you anything and they just go about their lives."

Every arrangement in the house made us feel cozy and close to home while still feeling the characteristics of the H'MOng people. Mr. Chu's family, everyone is friendly. In addition to eating hot and delicious meals with his family, we also enjoyed typical H'Mong dishes during the Lunar New Year. Located in a village that is not a crowded tourist area, the whole family can feel the natural scenery of the surrounding landscape and people. The fresh air, friendly people, clean, cozy house and delicious food made us initially plan to stay 2 nights, then decided to stay 1 more night. I also had a very special experience trying on H'Mong women's costumes. Unforgettable cultural experiences for the whole family. We plan to return here during the ripe rice season to harvest rice with Uncle Chu's family."

The house is beautifully decorated (probably the nicest place I stayed in the northern mountains of Vietnam), but keep in mind that it is made like this for tourists, since mountain ethnics usually do not care so much about that.<br/>Our stay was very comfortable (beds, bathroom, cleanliness, etc.), usually accommodations are more basic. The houses can accommodate 6 persons (3 double beds).<br/>There’s an easy 3 hour trek path in the surroundings, but after that hiking itineraries are demanding since it is located near Fansipan mountain range.<br/>Communication with Mai could not be better!

Và mình càng chắc chắn hơn về quyết định này khi được biết toàn bộ số tiền thuê phòng sẽ được dành để cho trẻ con trong bản đi học và chữa bệnh. <br/>Mình đã có 1 kỳ nghỉ rất dễ chịu tại đây, được gia đình bác Chư tiếp đón rất tình cảm. Lan, Nủ và vợ chồng bác Chư là những người hiền lành và tử tế, họ quan tâm mình chút một. Mình luôn được chuẩn bị cho rất nhiều đồ ăn, và bác Chư nấu ăn rất ngon. Bác luôn sợ mình đói. Chị Lan con nhờ 1 bạn nhỏ trong bản tới ngủ cùng cho mình đỡ sợ. Và trẻ con trên này luôn làm mình cảm thấy yên tâm và dễ chịu mà không một chút phiền hà. Mọi thứ rất thân thuộc.<br/>Có lẽ, đây không phải là một nơi bạn nên đến nếu như bạn yêu cầu một sự tiện nghi và sạch sẽ hoàn hảo. Nhưng nếu bạn thực sự muốn một nơi để có nghỉ ngơi, ngắm nhìn thiên nhiên, suy nghĩ, sống cùng với người dân tộc vùng Tây Bắc, thì đó là một sự lựa chọn tuyệt vời. <br/>Mình chắc chắn sẽ quay lại nơi đây vào một ngày gần nhất"

          "comments": "Ba năm trước mình đã mò mẫm đến nơi đây một cách rất tình cờ.  Khi chuyến đi Sapa kết thúc, mình vẫn tiếc nuối mãi khi không thể nghỉ chân tại nơi đây một ngày nào. Khi đó mình đã có ý định quay lại, thế mà mất tới tận ba năm sau mình mới trở lại được nhà anh Đức - chị Mai. <br/>Chuyến đi lần này của mình và các bạn thật may mắn. Chúng mình lên nhà đúng vào dịp trung thu, được góp phần tổ chức và chứng kiến tiệc phá cỗ của các em nhỏ tại bản ngay trên bếp ăn của các bạn Lan-Nủ dựng nên cạnh nhà. Chứng kiến những đứa trẻ vui cười khiến chúng mình cảm thấy cực kỳ hạnh phúc.<br/>Dịp này cũng đúng mùa lúa mới, mùa gặt của đồng bào, chúng mình được trở thành một phần của cộng đồng nơi đây, được cùng chung tay ra đồng mùa lúa mới. Chiều hôm ấy mấy đứa tụi mình ngủ quên, cả gia đình bác Chư đã đi làm từ đầu giờ chiều, mỗi người một việc. Em Sô vẫn đợi tụi mình thức dậy, để thực hiện lời hứa đưa anh chị ra đồng. Ngắm nhìn những thửa ruộng xếp thành tầng từ chân núi lên, được cùng đồng bào lao động trong tiếng cười nói, chứng kiến trẻ em nô đùa, nhảy nhót với đám rơm rạ, tụi bạn mình ai nấy được bữa cười giòn tan. Mấy đứa lóng ngóng tay chân như mình vẫn được cùng mọi người thực hiện việc thu hoạch những bông lúa chín nặng, đập bông lúa rơi ra thành từng hạt thóc, nhặt các cọng rạ thừa ra khỏi chỗ thóc vừa tách khỏi bông, rồi đóng thóc thành từng bao, vừa kịp chạy cơn mưa đang tới, chúng mình xúc động, quý trọng công sức người nông dân làm ra hạt gạo. Lúc đó mấy đứa mình đều suy nghĩ và tự nhủ không được phí phạm hạt gạo nào thêm nữa. Rồi mà gặt lúa xong thấy toát mồ hôi, chúng mình xuống suối tắm giải nhiệt. Dòng suốt mát lành chảy xuống từ Thác bạc, cùng lũ bạn í ới tạt nước vào nhau, tắm xong thì vội lau người đứa nào đứa nấy hơ người bên đống lửa đã nhóm sẵn. Mát lạnh, sảng khoái tuyệt vời!<br/>Mỗi sáng tụi mình ngồi trên võng tựa đầu vào cánh cửa nhà ngắm mặt trời mọc rực rỡ ló ra từng tia nắng hay chiều đến trèo lên đường to ngắm hoàng hôn buông, lòng chợt chẳng nghĩ chẳng lo, chẳng vui chẳng buồn. Một cảm giác bình yên.<br/>Mình nhớ ánh mắt bác Chư dõi theo núi rừng, bác có chút nuối tiếc khi được hỏi về sự thay đổi của Sapa, của đỉnh Fansipan. “Khác chứ, thay đổi nhiều rồi, khác lắm rồi.” Người Kinh len lỏi đến Sapa mang tiền cùng các dịch vụ để phục vụ du lịch, từ len lỏi, có nhiều nơi đã thành đa số. Nơi đó người H’mong đã bán đất cho người Kinh để người Kinh làm kinh tế. Ở Sín Chải đây, người H’mong không bán đất. Đồng bào người H’mong- mà dưới con mặt của mình đại diện là gia đình bác Chư - vẫn đang gìn giữ nếp sống xưa: vẫn đi rừng, vẫn làm nương rẫy, vẫn chăn nuôi lợn gà, vẫn quây quần bếp lửa nghi ngút khói quanh năm. Có chăng, khi làm hết việc rừng, việc đồng áng, đồng bào mới đi tìm thêm việc làm ngoài thị xã để cải thiện kinh tế. <br/>Chúng mình mong đồng bào nơi đây, gia đình bác Chư mãi yên tâm bám bản, giữ bản, giữ lấy cả bản sắc dân tộc H’mong. Chúng mình chúc những người đàn ông nơi đây mãi mạnh mẽ, chân thật, khiêm nhường. Chúc những người đàn bà nơi đây tiếp tục cười những nụ cười trọn vẹn, vẫn đảm đang, săn sóc cho gia đình. <br/>Có lẽ điều em viết sau đây sẽ hơi mang tính khuôn mẫu và sáo rỗng. Nhưng không viết ra không được. Chúng em cảm ơn anh chị Đức Mai. Qua đọc thêm về những điều anh Đức viết, em được biết anh chị đã tạo dựng nên một ngôi nhà H’mong đúng như nguyên bản cổ truyền, đã thực hiện hóa được một phần giấc mơ lãng mạn mà mười mấy năm trước hai anh chị đặt ra, cảm ơn anh chị đã kiên quyết mà giữ lại căn nhà này trong những lúc khó khăn nhất của cuộc sống và đã góp phần cải thiện đời sống sinh hoạt của cộng đồng, góp phần giữ gìn bản sắc dân tộc người H’mong."

Mr. Chu and his family took care of me really well despite the communication barrier. I stayed for 3 nights, but wished could stay longer. The place is beautiful, and peaceful. This is definitely a place to relax and rejuvenate. <br/>In the day time, Mr. Chu's family invited me to plant corn seeds at the farm on the mountain. After farming, they would invite me to the family lunch with abundance of food and rice wine and family time. What I like the most is that, none of the activities or experience is curated. It all felt natural based on our own effort to communicate with them and to be part of their community. <br/>Will definitely come again for sure!"

Mais nous avons vécu une expérience extraordinaire à Sin Chai : en suivant les conseils de Zung, nous sommes allés à la rencontre des habitants ; nous avons été invités à déjeuner par le Bible study group, nous avons assisté à une cérémonie rituelle pour chasser les esprits mauvais (incroyable), nous avons partagé les repas de Za, Chu et Lan, le mari de Lan nous a joué de la musique… C’était une immersion totale et probablement le souvenir le plus marquant de nos trois mois en Asie."

He even arranged a driver to bring us from the main market to the Homestay on the day of our arrival. The place is a little far from the center so he offered a free motorbike too! For a clean, spacious, getaway it is a must visit :)"

          "comments": "All we can say is WOW. Not only is the cabin and location beautiful, but Long and Giangg are wonderful hosts who truly care about their guests' experience. Long is very hospitable and welcoming and gave us excellent local recommendations. <br/>The cabin itself is perched on a hill overlooking rice paddies, right next to a small local farm. You wake up each morning to the beautiful sounds of nature and can enjoy your coffee overlooking the peaceful valley. It's well stocked for longer stays, and all the furniture is very comfortable. Wifi is also great! One thing to note is that this is not all one house, but rather 3 separate suites, each suite with one bedroom. <br/>The location is perfect if you are looking for a peaceful atmosphere. It's about a 15min drive out of Sa Pa town, and as long as you have transportation,  it's absolutely perfect. We only wish we would have spent 1 month here. Thank you, Long & Giangg for everything 🙏❤️"

Die Lage, nur etwa 15 Minuten vom Zentrum Sapas entfernt, war perfekt für uns. Wir haben die herrliche Natur und die unglaubliche Ruhe in dieser Gegend sehr genossen – eine willkommene Abwechslung zum Trubel.<br/>Das Haus selbst ist gemütlich und authentisch ländlich, genau das, was wir uns gewünscht hatten. Der Garten war ebenfalls wunderschön und trug zur entspannten Atmosphäre bei.<br/>Besonders hervorheben möchten wir unseren Gastgeber. Er war unglaublich hilfsbereit, gab uns tolle Empfehlungen für Unternehmungen in der Umgebung und hat sich sofort um kleinere Anliegen gekümmert. Als besonderes Highlight hat er uns sogar zu einem köstlichen, lokalen Abendessen eingeladen – eine wirklich nette Geste, die unseren Aufenthalt noch unvergesslicher gemacht hat.<br/>Wir haben uns rundum wohlgefühlt und können diese Unterkunft jedem wärmstens empfehlen."

My room was absolutely lovely with an incredible porch and view of the valley. It was incredibly relaxing place to stay.  The bathroom and the room were perfectly clean.  The large deck is exactly as you see it and is splendid place to sit with coffee or a beer.  The location is within easy walking distance of anywhere you would want to go, including the lake and some of the nearby walks. I would happily stay here again.

I’m so grateful that I was given an amazing room where you can see the mountains and the Fansipan train right from the window. The room is huge, and the bathroom is clean with a working heater.<br/>The hotel is also close to some great spots, and the views are breathtaking. This hotel has one of the best views of Sapa.<br/>What I’m especially thankful for is when I lost my purse with my passport at Fansipan. I sought help from the General Manager, Mr. Ha Huu Khoa, who helped me find it. Thanks to him, I was able to retrieve my purse from customer service at SunPlaza.<br/>Highly recommended!"

A huge shoutout to our fantastic host, Huu Khoa, who went above and beyond to fulfill our dream room request – a stunning view from the monorail railway. Tower B provided us with the most breathtaking scenery, making our stay truly dreamy.<br/>Special thanks to the male receptionist who assisted us throughout our stay. Despite the language barrier, he made every effort to communicate effectively, ensuring we felt welcome and attended to. <br/>While the room was a bit chilly and lacked a heater, the hot and cold shower more than made up for it. Overall, our experience at Joville Hotel was nothing short of magical. We cannot wait to return and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sapa. Many thanks to the entire team for making our stay unforgettable!"

The breakfast that are included were different every day & tasty. We stayed with them for dinner 1 night for a feast of Vietnamese culinary delight, from the fresh fish to the homemade spring rolls to the amazing vegetables, for 3 big lads from Canadian we were stuffed. And copious amounts of Hung’s homemade Plum wine. They drove us into town when we wanted but we enjoyed the magnificent beauty of being 5000 ft up on the side of the mountain over looking the valley below and staying around his home. Great coffee and views just up the road but the coffee at home was excellent. Recommend this 100% on your list, very rustic & a bit to get to but this family makes it worth the trip."

But the space you have is cool, there's a living room with fireplace, bathroom area, and 3 separate rooms - 1 an attic like room. The location isn't the best, but that's clear from the airbnb profile. It's a great space if you want to get away with friends and have a cosy place to stay."

Alles war sauber, keine Tiere, warmes Wasser sodass man tatsächlich die Badewanne nutzen konnte, schöner Pool, tolles Frühstück, Netflix Möglichkeit für schlechtes Wetter, super Service und die Lage war auch gut.  Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis!"

It is accessible and the car walks straight up to the gate so you don’t have to haul your luggage which can be an issue in Sa Pa hotels as there are narrow alleys. It’s a short walk from Moana Sapa and is very near to the main city centre too. Going uphill you can take grab but coming back one can easily walk back to the hotel.<br/>The hotel staff are very friendly and cooperative. They even helped us with our bus bookings to and from Sa Pa. <br/>THE POOL IS STUNNING!  It’s the best one of all the places we stayed in Vietnam. The room was clean, spacious and they’d clean up every day with fresh bathrobes and towels for you. Given the price it’s a steal. Cannot recommend it enough."

Leider gibt es auf dem Balkon keine Stühle um es länger zu genießen. <br/>Das Zimmer ist gross und bis auf ein paar kleine Mängel ( Gardine leicht schimmelig) sehr schön. Wir hatten Zimmer 508 und würden es jedem weiterempfehlen. Es ist sehr leise. Das Frühstück gibt es in Bufettform. Capuccino kann man extra bestellen, sowie Eier in verschiedenen Arten. Der Pool war warm, was es sehr angenehm machte, abends nochmal schwimmend den Ausblick zu genießen."

They even offered to contact the bus company if we wanted to have our pick up address changed while we wait on the lobby. such good customer service. Thank you so much! We'll definitely reccomend!"

From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome. They were warm, helpful, and always ready to assist with a smile. The views from the hotel are absolutely breathtaking — waking up to the misty mountains something I’ll never forget.<br/>The room was clean, cozy, and well-equipped with everything I needed. The bed was comfortable, and I appreciated the attention to detail in the decor. It really gave a local, authentic vibe. Breakfast each morning was fresh and delicious, with both Vietnamese and Western options.<br/>The location is perfect — just a short walk from Sapa town, but peaceful enough to feel like an escape. <br/>I highly recommend Fan SiPan View Hotel to anyone visiting Sapa."

Le seul bémol que nous pourrions soulever et la fermeté du matelas qui peut certainement déranger certaines personnes. Au début nous avons été surpris par la fermeté du matelas mais finalement nous avons très bien dormi. Je vous recommande vivement de venir y séjourner puisque le rapport qualité prix est excellent !"

Then the warm water was not enough to shower and was easily used up by 2 people even though the room was meant for 4 people. When that happened, the 3rd person waited for the supposed 15minutes for the water to heat up, but then the warm water only lasted 3minutes, and the rest had to shower in ice cold water, which was a huge deal breaker for us. When we informed the receptionist multiple times no proper action was taken other than telling us to wait 15 minutes between each shower even though the heater did not work the whole of the second day. One of the level 2 rooms that we had, there was brown toilet water dripping and there was a bad smell. Despite complaints issue was not fixed and we couldn't use the toilet at all. But the location is convenient and easy to get around and breakfast buffet is good."

They clean the room everyday, change towels and give bottled water everyday. Free breakfast buffet is so delicious. You can also order delicious food from their menu and they can also deliver it to your room. The hotel staff is so helpful and im very thankful to them, they help us to bring our luggage in our room and also help us to bring down when we check out. I want to give tip to the guy who helps us to carry our luggage to our room but unfortunately upon check out we did not see him, different guy help us when we check out and he is also kind! Thank you so much. Host is also responsive and helpful to our inquiries and favors. Very recommended."

Etwas Abseits des großen Trubels in Sapa und dennoch ist alles gut zu erreichen. Frühstücksbuffet war umfangreich. Eierspeisen wurden frisch zubereitet. Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen."

The place is situated far from noise and all we could hear was the nature (which is exactly what we came for to Sapa from the city noise of Hanoi). The description mentions self-checkin which was not exactly the case. We needed a staff member to open the cabin for us, which was quite unfortunate because we booked the place for an extra night so that we can checkin extra early (around 5 am), however the staff was very friendly and kindly helped us with the checkin after our arrival (even in heavy rain at night). This was easily the most peaceful stay we had in Vietnam and would come again anytime."

Feels homely and Jungles’s team were very polite and responsive especially when it came to guiding us to their homestay. Breakfast was also provided every morning! <br/>Room was cozy with high ceilings. Tall windows everywhere allowing for sunlight and ventilation. Easy access to our bikes as we were allowed to park our motorcycles right outside the room by the walkway. Room was very airy so a fan was barely needed let alone an ac. <br/>Area is not sheltered so an umbrella is required whenever it rains. Place is pitch black at night with only the main light source from the town below. It’s in the forests so expect insects to occasionally turn up by your door. There is no TV and fridge. <br/>Overall it was a pleasant experience. Only thing I didn’t expect was the lack of fridge but I did not mind the rest. I’d definitely book this place again if I’m back in Sappa!"

The place was really clean, comfortable with fans despite being so close to nature. It exceeded my expectations! The best part was the communication! Host gave clear instructions on how to find the place and was super helpful! They allowed us to place our luggage at reception after check in and even offered the common bathroom to shower before we catch our sleeper bus at 11pm. Really love the place and excellent service! This is the best Airbnb experience I had so far!! 11/10 would recommend everyone to give Jungle Stay a try!! Just take note that to get to this place, you have to climb a flight of stairs and steep slopes for about 5 mins! Good workout carrying luggage up and down during checking in and out! 😊"

The cabins are located in the most beautiful location, away from the hustle and bustle of the town but only a 10 minute walk away. Jungle has a separate balcony where you can enjoy drinks in the sun and another terrace area for breakfast and dinner if you choose to eat there. The cabin was cosy and clean and the beds (and bed linen) were amazing. A special thanks to our host KC who gave us such a warm welcome and made our stay memorable, we enjoyed our chats with him and nothing was too much trouble! We'd love to return one day."

Außerdem muss man mit Insekten im Zimmer rechnen, da es keine Netze an den Fenstern gibt und die Holzdielen Ritzen haben durch welche man direkt nach unten blicken kann. Insgesamt hatten wir trotzdem eine schöne Zeit. Allerdings ist der Anstieg zur Hütte eher für körperlich fitte Menschen zu empfehlen."

It’s very close to Cat Cat village so that’s a plus and the center is a quick moto ride oh and if you like animals they have a friendly little puppy that is so nice. They have little shop at the bottom where you can get drinks and a few snacks I think and they also rent the traditional dress of the people there if you’re interested. I highly recommend this place because you won’t be disappointed"

There is a hiking trail that starts right at the door.<br/>The place is 5 minutes away with a taxi from the city center and it’s pretty quiet at night. I recommend this place for people who want to enjoy beautiful nature and still have the chance to visit Sapa and see the city without having to live in crowded areas."

It’s a cute private cottage with warm wooden interiors. <br/>What brilliant views!!<br/>Only setback was that it was a little away(about 1.5kms) from the center but if you’re planning to rent a scooter it wouldn’t be a problem at all. You can walk to the center too but it’s a steep walk. Walking at night might not be a great idea since the road is not lit. <br/>The staff was very sweet and helpful, especially Linhi. <br/>Over all it was a wonderful experience"

Only thing I would like to add is the attentiveness of the staff could be better when customers are at the check in or reception.  <br/>Secondly, worth noting that it takes 5-7 mins with the buggy to get inside the accomodation- they are fairly responsive but it does add to the time. The location is right next to Moana (walkable!) but for anything else, you will need a taxi as it’s uphill and not an easy walk!"

Hosts are super responsive and happy to help with luggage and drop offs/ pick ups on the main road due to the location being a little out of the way for taxis. The only drawbacks were a plumbing issue that required me to move tents, and poor wifi at the second tent location. However, still a 5/5 rating for location, views, and easy communication with hosts!"

The restaurant and bar being at the same place was really convenient. Breakfast was lovely. They provided bike rentals at the venue for the price you get outside and the bikes were in much better condition and we did not need to walk far or look around for one.<br/>We got there when it was full moon and everything was gorgeous. at night you get to see the city from a far which looks like a really nice steampunk city.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay. The views, staff, service. Was definitely worth it."

The stuff members are super friendly and helpfull. Not all of them speak englisch but it was never a problem because they help you or reach out to someone else. You can also eat at the Restaurant there and it was delicious. They have a shuttle service and they can drive you up and down because the road to the Phansi is not made for cars. The service was for free and available kind of all the time. Thanks again for this beautiful experiance."

This place gives you the sensation of being on top of the mountain, surrounded by fog and tranquility. Everything about it is simply perfect. The food is delicious, and you definitely shouldn’t miss their egg coffee—it’s a must-try! The rooms are spotless, and the location, a bit away from the hustle and bustle, serves a purpose. If you’re looking for a peaceful escape amidst the mountains, this is the ideal place to unwind."

The staff is also so accommodating and kind and the food was so delicious. In order to get to the property, you have to take a buggy which we did not mind at all, and they were super efficient in terms of dropping and picking us up from the drop off location. If you are ever in Sapa and want a peaceful and picturesque room, I highly highly recommend!"

The hosts were incredibly kind and attentive, making us feel right at home and helping with everything. This is the perfect blend of comfort and nature — highly recommended for anyone looking to experience Sapa in a unique and peaceful way!"

It was my favourite accomodation that I booked throughout Vietnam. The place was overlooking the rice fields, exactly what the photos showed and I felt really comfortable during our stay, staff was so friendly and we had a great time with all of them! Huong was easy to communicate with and helped us throughout! I definitely will be back here again!"

Das ist bei der Lage des Resorts nicht zu vermeiden, aber der Ausblick über die Reisterrassen ist es definitiv wert!"

For breakfast, you could choose from several options – all were delicious and beautifully presented. The dining area is also open to non-staying guests and basically feels like its own little viewing platform. The drinks were great, and dinner is definitely worth trying as well!<br/>One small downside, though it did not affect our overall impression: unfortunately, we accidentally broke a glass. When we returned it, no one mentioned that we would have to pay for it – we only found out at check-out, which was a bit of a surprise. A bit unfortunate, as accidents like this can happen."

They offer their e-car service to fetch and send you to the top of the residential area, so it’s easier for you to travel to and fro the town area. You can walk yourselves to enjoy the local views and houses, but it’s a bit far and full of puddles so the e-car service was great! The views at the accoms were mostly covered my mist/fog due to us coming in Feb, but we still loved it! It was cold and cosy. There is also heating in the airbnb, although I could be quite inconsistent. Take note there’s no TV but wasn’t a problem for us, as the views and mist covered balcony kept us occupied with its beauty. They offer complementary bfast which is really nice. The staff were also all very friendly and accommodating. If we ever come back to Sapa, we might just stay here again! :)"

          "comments": "We booked all 3 rooms for a our group of 4, the location is close to a Village called Ta Van which is on the Trekking route, there's great cafes & restaurants a short walk away for food. The views are absolutely breathtaking. It's about a 25 mins taxi from Sapa town, we managed to get a Grab for our whole stay, a car or bike is needed if you wanted to explore the area. There was a couple of land slides when we went but this didn't seem to stop the drivers.<br/>the rooms are very simple, but beds are clean and comfy, the shower does produce some hot water even though the listing says it doesn't, there are a lot of bugs due to being right next to the the rice paddies, and there's no air con but a fan is provided. we did notice a little bit of mould on the walls, this could be caused by the rainy season.<br/>The hosts are super kind, they waited until 8pm for us to arrive, they also have a really cool souvenir shop above from local artists, we all bought something, absolutely would recommend!!"

My family and I arrived at Sapa at 5am in the morning and Anh was actively messaging me making sure we were able to find the place. When we arrived, he greeted us with a smile and helped us check in. <br/>There are 3 rooms total, I personally slept in bedroom 3, and the only downside I would say is there are a lot of insects because the toilet’s ventilation was a hole in the wall. If you don’t prefer insects, I will suggest sleeping in bedroom 1 and 2! <br/>Overall, I really enjoyed my stay with my family here and it is a view I will never get back home <3"

          "comments": "My friends and I booked Anh's place to stay for a couple of days so that we could experience the true Sa Pa villages away from the main hustle and bustle of the town, and we are so glad that we did! Anh was very responsive from the beginning and even helped to arrange a taxi to come and collect us from our last place and bring us to the Air bnb. He also got two scooters for us so that we were able to ride around the village. The rooms themselves were so cosy and beautifully designed - we were all extra happy with the electric blankets as it could get really cold at night. There are also heaters in each room and hot showers so we never felt cold after a day out in the rain. If you are looking for a peaceful, relaxing place to stay in one of the Hmong villages, I would 100% recommend Anh's place. Thank you so much for making our trip so special :)"

Big open windows of the rice fields (which I hope Anh will put more clearly in the preview, because waking up to the sunrise when we decided not to cover the window blinds was the best decision) and easy access to several hikes which we decided to take! Sapa was amazing, but seeing this town was even better. Some of our friends decided to extend their stay once they realised that the bed had a warmer function we didn't know about before arrival. We decided to go hiking without a guide, and locals helped us find the right paths when we were at forks in the road. The supermarkets were in easy walking distance and open until 21. The nearby restaurants also had amazing food with very generous portions. We were able to sit down and have coffees while talking to some very nice people we met while we were here."

Nga and Dung were perfect hosts and made us feel like part of the family - taking us around the village to meet their friends and celebrate the national holiday, and inviting us to eat with them in the evening. The food was the best we have had in Vietnam and from the house we were able to do lovely hike and paraglide across the stunning valley. We will recommend to all our friends!"

Le cadre est merveilleux au bord d’un ruisseau et dans un village typique enfin les rizières en escalier donnent un panorama unique. Le petit déjeuner était excellent et le soir on a fait le choix de manger chez Nga et c’est une véritable perle à la cuisine !  C’était bien sûr très calme et on a apprécié la présence du petit chiot et à la fin du séjour les filles ont pu faire quelques parties de uno avec les fils de Nga. On recommande vivement !!!"

Perfectly off the beaten path. Van is a wonderful host, we enjoyed dinner with her and seeing her farm. We spent one night, getting there via motorcycle. The road up to the house is challenging to ride, so if you don’t have much experience, highly suggest walking."

The food by Van  was simple but very delicious and we also loved the tea she offered.<br/>Last thing: you should like dogs if you come here :-)<br/>They will great you with barking and grunting but are very friendly, chilled at the Lodge sometimes during day and night, hunting for mice and also walked by our side when we went down to the village/for a small hike, which was very cute."

Just getting driven up the mountain to her place was an adventure! Exploring the hills and town was lovely. The local hot spring baths are great for a dip (especially while surrounded by those mountain views).<br/>I travelled in via bus/motorbike/walking and had a great time. But would probably recommend this place to people with their own transport. <br/>Van was an amazing host, I was a bit disorganised but she was able to help me out a ton (everyone please remember to bring enough cash with you from the city, there are barely any ATMs out here and a lot of them don’t work with international cards).<br/>Overall, would definitely recommend."

Be mindful of the insects, though!<br/>We are also incredibly grateful to Van for her help with our arrival and departure.

Anyone who wants some peace and quiet at the edge of Vietnam, disconnect from the outside world - this is the place to go.<br/>A tip for future travelers: use Maps' satellite mode to find Van's lovely home more easily because it can get be a little tricky doing so without any internet.<br/> She was kind enough to prepare dinner and breakfast for me and the whole stay/place felt something out of Studio Ghibli animation - couldn't recommend it more!"

This wonderful accommodation with a breathtaking view is located at the top of a mountain, secluded among home-grown vegetables! It has everything you need in such a quiet place. You can really relax here! We went for a walk through the fields with their three dogs and in the evening we had dinner together with Van. She prepared super tasty and simple vegetarian food for us, thank you for that!<br/>Don't underestimate the walk up! It's not a problem on foot, but it takes about 30 minutes. It's quicker to get to the top on a motorcycle, but the road is a challenge and you have to be very careful on the way down... it can be very difficult when it rains.<br/>But this was also described by Van and is really the only thing you need to know!<br/>We would have loved to stay one more night in this peaceful place!"

We arrived at night and we did not know so we hike for so long in the dark but the host explained to us that we can grab a moto bike taxi if we don’t want to hike. we are the only ones on the mountain and you are in a indigenous village where tourists don’t come often. We were the only ones there and it was an amazing experience. People were really friendly. The host, van is amazing at first she seems a bit shy but she is really kind. she helped us so much during our stay. She answered all ours questions, she helped us to rent a motobike , to book a bus and a taxi motobike. She is amazing. She invited us in her home and she cooked for us for a small fee. Her cooking is insanely good & healthy. The bungalow is just perfect super eco friendly. I will never forget her two dogs, they were so friendly and cute."

          "comments": "\"A Hidden Gem in Moc Chau!\"<br/>I recently had the pleasure of staying at this charming homestay in Moc Chau, and it was an unforgettable experience. The cozy and rustic atmosphere immediately made me feel at home, with beautiful wooden interiors and stunning views of the surrounding hills. The hosts were incredibly warm and welcoming, always making sure that I had everything I needed. The highlight was waking up to a fresh, misty morning and enjoying a delicious breakfast with locally sourced ingredients. The peaceful environment, combined with the authentic experience, made it the perfect escape from city life. Highly recommend this homestay to anyone looking for a peaceful and authentic retreat in Moc Chau!"

The staff is extremely hospitable from the moment you arrive, always friendly, soft-spoken, and smiling. Breakfast and afternoon tea is included, and the restaurant serves very good dinner (upon reservation) with large portions, as well as simple lunch. Although we didn't come in the best season (the staff said August-September is more beautiful) we loved waking up to the view of the valley and town. Note that the hotel only accepts cash for additional services and dining, and it is difficult to exchange cash or access an ATM in the area.<br/>Special thanks to the staff at Mường Lò Retreat :-)"

          "comments": "Definitely an aesthetically pleasing lodging facility for cloud-hunters in Ta Xua! The sheer rawness and relative lack of development in the area makes it one of the very few places left in Vietnam where foreign tourists are more of an exception than the rule. The ecolodge itself is a nice spot to relax, unwind and observe nature in all its brilliancy. However, if you’re here for cloud-hunting, beware—the roads, especially the back-end of the Dinosaur Spine peak may make you crap your pants if you’ve no experience in mountain-biking. Highly recommend hiring motorbike taxis if that’s the case.<br/>Also, come prepared if you’re vegan/vegetarian; I was expecting little to no options at their restaurant and that’s indeed the case. The staff are friendly though, but only one of them speaks conversant English. As a rule, always carry cash in Vietnam; cards aren’t accepted here. Remember, this is remote Vietnam!<br/>Overall, if you have realistic expectations, this place won’t disappoint you."

Khanh also picked us up from where the bus dropped us and also contacted the bus company so that we're picked up at his place when we left. Honestly a perfect place to explore the beautiful Mu Cang Chai and to have some nice genuine experience! I will definitely come back!! The internet is suepr fast, perfect for working 😉"

L’emplacement bien que reculé et difficile d’accès (nous a dû monter à pied car les voitures ne peuvent pas monter et il n’y avait pas de grab nous sommes arrivés tôt), nous permet de faire des randonnées car à proximité de point d’intérêt.

Surrounded by the unique colours of the rice fields, an authentic and pure location.<br/>We met special people who made us feel part of their family. We will always carry with us the memory of the last hug before we left. 🥰 Dinh and his brother were great in helping us organise our trip back to Ha Giang, showing willingness, dedication and care for our request. <br/>We recommend to organise transport in advance as the house is not easy to reach. <br/>It was for sure one of the best memories of our trip in Vietnam ❣️"

We really recommend to take a motorbike full day trip with your personal local driver where you will see the whole valley, seriously you will see everithing! Every dinner was with the owners family and all food was from local fields and gardens. Seriously recomend to stay here more than 1 night. We were there in August and almost alone with just a few tourists. Probably out best experience from Vietnam!"

Beim AirBnB angekommen, wurden wir herzlichst von Dinh seiner Familie begrüßt. Der Ausblick aus dem Zimmer war, genauso wie auf den Bildern zu erkennen, einzigartig. Auch das Abendessen mit Dinh seiner Familie war eine Erfahrung, die man unbedingt erlebt haben sollte. Es gab lokale Speisen und Köstlichkeiten. Für faire Preise kann man bei Dinh auch Wandern-Touren buchen, die durch die schönen Reisfelder führen und einem das Leben und die Kultur der Einheimischen nähen bringen.<br/>Für jeden, der nach Mu-Cang-Chai kommt, ist Dinh sein AirBnB nur zu empfehlen!"

Although it rained the entire time we were there, they were still accommodating and were super friendly with everyone. All the homecooked meals were honestly superb - their veggie dishes were my favourite! <br/>If it's going to be rainy weather, remember to dress accordingly - it gets very cold and windy as you're high up in the mountains. I was not prepared at all, but I still had a blast and it was definitely an experience remembering!"

We are so happy that we got to this place and got to know Chu, Dinh and their heart warming family who was so stunningly friendly. The place is as soothing and quite remote. We had to “climb” smallest ways between the rice fields with our motorbikes for quite some time (which could be fun for more experienced drivers) until we found out, that there is a wider better road. If you come here by yourself, take the street to the north in Q58C+MWM, QL32, Púng Luông, Mù Cang Chải, Yên Bái, Vietnam. You can still walk the small ways between the fields by food😊 <br/>We hope to come to this place again in the future!😊 Best regards,<br/>Johannes & Terje"

And they made the best coffee too! I cannot recommend this place enough. <br/>We booked a half a day hike with Chù which I really recommend.

Das beste Essen in Vietnam für uns.<br/>Die Umgebung ist wunderschön und lädt zu diversen kleinen und großen Wandertouren ein.

Hosts waited for me and picked me up, brought me to the bus when I left. Gave me directions and also invited me to a local party. Excelent communication, both hosts speak English, always checked to see if all is good. Had to spend one of my 3 nights at a different guest house because some \"Airbnb error\" , the place was of lower quality, but in the end didn't mind it.<br/>The place is as advertised, great bed, good shower, cleaning wise could be better."

There is even a nice balcony and a fire pit where we drank and played guitar. The best part about staying at Nam’s was that he made a big Vietnamese feast every night with unlimited rice wine. It was nice because there were other Americans staying at the homestay also, so Nam made a mix of American and Vietnamese dishes to make us feel at home. One of the Americans had her birthday while she was there, so Nam went out of his way to get her Swiss cakes and candles to celebrate her birthday. Would definitely recommend his homestay for anyone visiting the Mu Cang chai region!"

Inutile d’aller ailleurs, il faut manger la bas tous les soirs : les menus sont variés, les produits de grande qualité et c’est une manière de découvrir une cuisine simple et absolument délicieuse.

Wir waren Gleitschirmfliegen, im Fluss hinter dem Haus baden und rund herum konnten wir die wunderschönen Reisfeldern bestaunen.  Die Gastgeberin hat uns den Transfer von der Bushaltestelle zur Unterkunft organisiert und tagsüber haben wir Motorräder ausgeliehen. <br/>Das Essen wurde von Nga selbst zubereitet und ist super lecker. Ich kann die Unterkunft zu 100% empfehlen."

The rooms were cute and bijou. Whilst the shower and toilets were at the end of the corridor, they were of very high quality. The home-cooked food was exemplary (yummy +++), and Thanh Nga treated us to an amazing guided tour around the valley. We truly enjoyed our time and will be recommending Thanh's homestay to all our friends and family. The picturesque surroundings are breathtaking!"

The house is set in a peaceful place next to the river and guests have a really warm welcome from the family. We were left to ourselves but also a welcomed to use the space as we wanted. The home cooked meal from their garden was absolutely delicious, bed was super confortable and there were lots of nice homely touches too. Highly reccomended if you are after a more alternative vibe. We hope to come back one day!"

Een prachtige omgeving waar je mooie wandelingen kan maken door de rijstterrassen en kleine dorpjes. Nam en zijn familie zijn heel gastvrij en relaxed. Zijn vrouw kan zeer goed koken, we hebben iedere avond hier gegeten en iedere dag werd er anders gekookt en alles supervers. Nam reageert ook zeer snel via telefoon en kan alles voor je regelen ook de transport heen of terug, heel handig. We hebben die 4 dagen amper toeristen gezien en het voelde heel authentiek aan. Een echte aanrader en een heel lieve familie!"

And quite a variety (we atayed 2 nights). Oh and stay 2-3 nights if you can. Nam will agow you where to walk. Best rice fields are in La Pan Tan. <br/>Loved little 5 month puppy Lou Lou.  <br/>If you turn right if you look to the fields there is an awesome out and back trail. Highly recommend."

It was possibly the best time during our four week trip in Vietnam. <br/>The homestay is located in stunning surroundings not far from one of the best views in Mu Cang Chai. In addition, the area is inhabited by sweet, local Hmong people which adds to the overall experience.<br/>We also had some of our best meals in Vietnam there prepared by Nam’s wife. Bring your appetite as the food is delicious and plentiful.<br/>We arrived from Ninh Binh and were not able to make it time for the bus to MCC from Hanoi, so Nam helped us arrange a private transfer from Yen Bai. <br/>We look forward to coming back to this unique place!"

Sua moglie è un'ottima host e cuoca, abbiamo mangiato benissimo. Nam ci ha fatto sentire come a casa e ci ha portato a fare un tour delle risaie che ricorderemo per sempre. Grazie Nam!

Wir nutzten die Möglichkeit, im familiären Umfeld das Abendessen einzunehmen. Seine Frau ist eine sehr gute Köchin und wir bekamen eine abwechslungsreiche Küche serviert. Genaus war es auch mit dem Frühstück. Auf Nachfrage hat A Su uns ein Moped ausgeliehen, mit dem wir die Umgebung noch besser erkunden konnten. Die Unterkunft liegt etwas abgelegen, was aber mit Taxitransport kein Problem war. Es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall hierher zu kommen, da man mit einem grandiosen Ausblick auf Berge und Reisfelder belohnt wird. Die Kommunikation lief auf Englisch, wenn es zu kompliziert wurde half die Übersetzungsapp und wir haben viel über Vietnam, die Region und über die Menschen und ihr Leben hier erfahren. <br/>Wir sind als Gäste gekommen und als Freunde gegangen."

As the host helpfully pointed out, the elevator can be a bit slow during peak times, but their proactive communication and tips on when to avoid the rush made it a non-issue. We would definitely recommend this place for a great stay in Vung Tau."

If you have a mold allergy, we recommend sticking to the lower floors like this one on the 9th floor, everything above 12 seemed hit or miss. This one felt much better than others we saw.<br/>The balcony was a highlight, our favorite spot to unwind at night, with a nice table and chairs for relaxing and morning coffee. Also perfect for working. Laundry was clean and there’s a large drying rack on the balcony which came in very handy.<br/>Supermarket in walking distance. Cafe right in the courtyard. Motorbike rental was super easy, and the building has great amenities. The elevator wait wasn’t bad at all, never more than five minutes. Overall, a solid stay with good vibes and practical comforts."

The Netflix on the TV was much appreciated also.<br/>Unfortunately the room did have a strong durian smell which was off-putting and the lifts took quite a long time so bear in mind if you book a taxi. The beach nearby was shut which we did not know so visited the rooftop pool but there was no beds to lounge apart from in the pool itself and half of the lounge area was closed which was disappointing."

Điều này thực sự làm cho tôi cảm thấy thoải mái và hài lòng ngay từ đầu.<br/>View ban công nhìn rất thoáng, có thể nhìn ra biển, khá rộng. Tôi không thể tin nổi rằng mình có thể tận hưởng một khung cảnh như vậy từ một căn studio. Không gian thoáng đãng này đã tạo ra một bầu không khí yên bình và thư giãn cho kỳ nghỉ của tôi.<br/>Mặc dù cách âm ở hành lang có vẻ chưa tốt lắm, nhưng nhìn chung, không gian bên trong căn phòng vẫn cảm giác rất tĩnh lặng và thoải mái. Âm thanh bên ngoài không ảnh hưởng nhiều đến trải nghiệm của tôi.<br/>Tôi cũng muốn khen ngợi chủ nhà vì sự chu đáo và thân thiện của họ. Họ đã cung cấp mọi thông tin cần thiết cho tôi và luôn sẵn sàng giúp đỡ trong suốt thời gian lưu trú của tôi."

Điểm thứ 2 là ở tầng 1 là spa của cô chủ, khách ở home được giảm 20% các dịch vụ cơ bàn, mình dùng gói massage cổ vai gáy thấy rất thích.

Tuy chỉ ở 1 đêm nhưng mình cảm nhận được cách các bạn quan tâm đến khách hàng qua những điều nhỏ nhặt từ những mẩu giấy nhỏ ở khắp nơi,  hộp thuốc sơ cứu, bình nước lọc ở từng phòng. Gia đình mình rất hài lòng về trải nghiệm tại nơi ở.<br/>Cám ơn các bạn đã góp phần làm cho chuyến đi của gia đình mình trở nên trọn vẹn. <br/>Mong các bạn sẽ tiếp tục duy trì tinh thần này cho những khách hàng sau và chúc các bạn ngày càng đông khách."

From meeting us before checking in to being able to respond right away.<br/>We were a bit worried because of the reviews around the back beach with constructions, but THIS IS THE BEST (me coming from the Philippines with lots of beaches), a 5 min walk from her place, baby powder like sand, literally just me and my husband in the beach.<br/>Lotte Mall is just 4 mins walk from her place which makes all convenient. The balcony view is stunning any time of the day, where you can see the Vung Tau skyline and the sea.<br/>When we go back to Vung Tau, we will stay at Kim's once again!"

In the beginning the host wanted to charge a fee, but once I changed the reservation to 3 in the app, the price stayed the same. Theres 2 seperate rooms, with big beds. You can expect atleast 3-4 people to be able to stay.<br/>The sauna was closed. The gym required you to sign up. The host did not mention anything regarding this. The security told me that I had to sign up to use the gym, so I felt somewhat intrusive when I was there. Luckily the security guard told me it’s okay. But i still felt weird being there. If I was told this information prior it would have been very helpful to avoid a awkward situation.<br/>The elevator is unfortunately terrible. How can a property have so many people but such a lack of elevators… its unfortunate. It can take you 5-10 minutes to go down or up. Theres always a lineup aswell."

It offers a rare coastal view in Vung Tau, with a balcony that provides a distant view of the Christ statue. The bedroom is relatively private and also offers a view of the city.<br/>The room is very clean, the furniture is beautiful, and everything is just perfect.<br/>One thing to note is that the hot water requires turning on the electrical switch on the wall."

Bed is very hard but tolerable for a few nights. Place could have been cleaner- hair on the floor, wash cloths that had already been used and left in kitchen. Host was very responsive and provided more towels. Overall location didn’t have much to do as the local beach is under construction. We rented a scooter and spent most of our time by Front Beach. It would have been helpful to know local beach is accessible but limited. Also a lot of trash on the beach. Not a reflection of this unit, but not the place to walk on the beach."

Only a few minute walk to the popular fish market (chợ cá Xóm Lưới), walk a few minutes more and you're in front beach (bãi trước) where the locals hang out in the big pretty park, perfect for an early morning or late afternoon walk. Great location and so is the host Cherry, very easy going and very accommodating, check-in and check-out was a breeze. Will stay here when I'm in this seaside town again. Highly recommended!"

Having a playground and mini water park right in the building was a real blessing with a 5 year old. My little one had an absolute ball splashing around while we could actually relax for a change. Perfect setup for families - highly recommend if you're heading to Vung Tau with kids.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

L’hôte a été disponible et réactif, répondant rapidement à nos besoins. <br/>Le quartier est animé, avec un centre commercial tout proche et de très bons restaurants à proximité.<br/>Quelques points à noter : l’attente pour l’ascenseur peut être longue aux heures de pointe, notamment entre midi et 14h. La piscine au 36e étage, bien que magnifique, est réservée aux personnes mesurant au moins 1m40, ce qui nous a empêchés d’en profiter tous ensemble. Une piscine pour enfants est disponible au 5e étage, mais l’eau ne semblait pas très propre lors de notre passage.<br/>Malgré cela, je recommande vivement ce logement pour son confort, sa localisation et la qualité de l’accueil. <br/>Nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir en famille."

The apartment is close to the beach and a grocery store. Pool and gym are quite a bit smaller than the pictures would suggest. The beachfront is under construction at the moment but there is access to the water. Early morning runs along the beach were the highlight for me. It's worth a trip by ferry if you're looking to get out of Saigon for a few days. Food selection is a bit limited but weather is great (cool in the morning and night)."

Elle fait de son mieux pour nous arranger et pour que nous passons un bon séjour. La Villa que nous avons louée était disponible à 14h le jour d'arrivée. Nous sommes arrivés vers 11h, elle nous a de suite proposé une autre Villa proche qui est encore plus belle. MERCI pour sa gentillesse. Dans la nuit nous avons été privé d'électricité à cause d'une grosse tempête et elle était présente au téléphone. Le quartier avait l'électricité coupé mais dès le lendemain elle est venue nous présenter ses excuses, bien qu'elle ne soit pas à l'origine de cette coupure. Merci pour sa délicatesse et son professionnalisme. Je ne manquerai pas de faire appel à elle lors de mon prochain séjour."

          "comments": "There were a couple problems. <br/>1. We booked this place for a longer stay of 20 days, and after the first night we decided to leave because of the uncleanliness. There was lots of mold in the bathroom and the kitchen vent, and it also smelled horrible. Every cabinet we opened had a different unsettling smell, as well as the entire hallway and every part of the building we passed. <br/>2. This place is filled to the brim with children and is simply overcrowded. The pool was chaotic and loud, and the wait for the elevator was unnecessarily long. Also the people aren’t the nicest. <br/>I’m not one to write bad reviews, but I felt that the advertisement for this place is misleading. <br/>Host’s communication was great, and she was extremely nice and was very apologetic. I fortunately received a refund, but I will definitely never find myself in this city again."

Chỉ có 1 điểm trừ về phía The Sóng là chỗ giữ xe có tính phí, và mức phí không rõ ràng lắm.<br/>Khi nhận phòng thì phòng rất sạch sẽ, gọn gàng, có mùi thơm dễ chịu và bày trí giống với trên ảnh. Chủ nhà rất chu đáo khi chuẩn bị đủ các vật dụng cần thiết, bao gồm cả sữa tắm, dầu gội, nước rửa chén, nước giặt, 1 tủ khăn, chăn gối dự phòng, máy sấy, bàn là cầm tay v.v. Nhìn chung, không gian nhỏ gọn, ấm cúng, phù hợp cho cặp đôi hoặc gia đình, nhóm bạn nhỏ. Chủ nhà cũng đã rất nhiệt tình khi hỗ trợ mình checkout trễ 1 tiếng không tính phí và luôn phản hồi nhanh chóng mỗi khi mình cần trợ giúp. View phòng thực tế không quá gần biển và núi mà phần nhiều là thành phố nhưng vẫn có thể ngắm được hoàng hôn (nhưng tia nắng sẽ rất chói nhen)."

Also, the 2nd room is not sealed, it has an opening so that you can share the air conditioning from the master bedroom.  so if you talk the other person in that room can hear you.

The amenities in the complex were good - pool clean and quiet enough and lots of communal spaces within the blocks. Overall cleanliness levels of the flat were okay but could be improved- we found several small cockroaches, which the host says they will address before the next guests. Bathroom drains occasionally quite smelly, though this appeared to be a wider issue than just this flat."

The co-host, Vy, has been extremely responsive and incredibly helpful, making the whole process seamless.<br/>One standout feature of my stay was undoubtedly the breathtaking ocean view from the apartment. It added a touch of serenity to each morning, setting the perfect tone for the day ahead. Plus, the quiet and private atmosphere of the location was exactly what I was looking for, offering a retreat from the hustle and bustle.<br/>Overall, I couldn't be happier with the experience. It's a definite recommendation from me, and I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to book and enjoy my stay."

Hai phòng ngăn cách nhau bằng cửa kéo, có thể thông qua nhau, phù hợp cho gđ. Mình đi giữa tuần nên ko bị tình trạng kẹt thang máy. À, còn cô H quản phòng siu dễ thương nữa, vừa mới gặp mà cô hỗ trợ xách đồ dùm gđ mình, rồi hướng dẫn các thứ trong phòng. Đến h checkout mà mưa to quá, mình báo cô sợ về phòng k kịp thì cô kêu cứ từ từ ko vội. Nói chung xứng đáng nha mn ơi."

It was much easier to get an elevator on Monday & Tuesday.<br/>The complex also boasts kid’s’ lazy river on the 5th floor as well as a rooftop pool. If you are from the west you need to know that bathing suits are monitored. My friend is 66 years old and wore a bathing suit that looks like a tank top<br/>and skirt.  She was not allowed to get in the pool. This is one of those cultural differences…which adds merriment to travel. <br/>This condo has a nice balcony overlooking the largest round about in Vietnam and the 6th largest in the world. <br/>IFurthermore it is in walking distance to the Lotte shopping center.  You can also see the Christ statue and Buddha as well as a beautiful city and Mountain View … especially at sunset.<br/>After 6 weeks in Vietnam this is BY FAR  the cleanest place I’ve stayed.<br/>Book here!"

          "comments": "Rooms don't have windows, which can be a turn off for some, but I'm perfectly fine with it since there's no dead air smell and bath room has sufficient air ventilation. Walls are a bit thin though, so be mindful, it's not so thin that you have to whisper everytime you speak, but better not be too loud, normal volume is almost inaudible. Bathroom is a bit small, but is clean, doesnt smell, both hotncold water available, ventilation system can dry your clothes if you're desperate :/ <br/>Other than that, shared space is great, there's parking space, water, a kitchen, a big desk, plenty of plants and good air. If you ever have a party big enough, just book the entire place, that'd be such a cool hangout spot<br/>Location is good imo, not too far from the beach, near the center of the city, and is VERY close to a SUPER popular bakery spot!<br/>Host is nice, he calls be beforehand to confirm our checkin hour, and answered our question at around as late as 11:45 pm<br/>9.5/10 would recommend"

Sáng còn pha cafe cho tụi mình. Cô còn cho mình ăn chuối cô tự trồng tự sấy. Lúc về còn tặng mình trái đu đủ ăn ngon lắm. Hai vợ chồng mình cực kì thích ở đây, nằm trên núi nên yên tĩnh, mát mẻ. Ban công có view nhìn ra biển chill cực, đúng gu thích yên bình của hai đứa. Nếu hai vợ chồng có dịp ra Vũng Tàu sẽ ghé ở tiếp."

Vì do kế hoạch chuyến đi được thêm 1 đêm mùng 1 tại vũng tàu nên mình book gấp 1 đêm tại nhà cô chú, đêm còn lại thì bạn con đã book sẵn một chổ khác rồi 🥹<br/>Hai đứa con sẽ quay lại vào một dịp gần nhất, tụi con rất thích không gian của nhà mình. Một đêm nghỉ ngơi tuyệt vời không nằm trong kế hoạch, sáng dậy mở mắt thấy biển và núi, cây cối xung quanh nhà thật bình yên. Tụi con cảm ơn cô chú nha"

It's a one-of-a-kind experience, I appreciate the view every morning waking up, which feels like a vacation in Southern French. The room's clean & Ton & Thanh are very kind hosts. Ton's an intellectual with great understanding and expansive knowledge of Vietnam heritage & city development. Our group really enjoys chatting with him. I will for sure come back to this Airbnb for 3rd and 4th time"

The hill up was not easy for cabs to drive up (so mostly we prefer motorbike or walk). Walling might be far, but the scene was worth it. The view (especially from the mutual rooftop) was amazing, I loved it. Also adored the peacefil quietness there. Hope to come up in my next vacation :-)"

The view here is absolutely breathtaking as it is from the balcony. My partner and I had a wonderful time chatting with our hosts and learning about Vietnam which helped us to plan the rest of our holiday. Highly recommended. Thank you Ton and Tan!"

The location is simply perfect – close to everything you need, and the ocean view is a highlight every morning. The apartment looked exactly like the pictures: modern, stylish, and very cozy. However, there were a few minor inconveniences, such as the lack of cutlery (there was only one knife and no forks) and unfortunately, the kitchen and bathroom were not entirely clean. Additionally, there were cockroaches in the kitchen, which was unpleasant. Despite these issues, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the apartment because of its great location and lovely decor. Thank you very much!"

Wir waren leider nur für 2 Nächte hier, aber es ist durchaus denkbar sich längere Zeit in dieser Wohnung zu verbringen. Der weitläufige Strand ist keine 5 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar. Aktuell finden dort allerdings Bauarbeiten statt, wenn man aber ein wenig am Strand entlang läuft, bekommt man davon nichts mehr mit."

On top of this Thang the host is also very easy going and accommodating to the guest's request. Highly recommended!"

Our favorite restaurant, Ganh Hao 1, was just a 5-min walk away.<br/>The homestay was comfortable and cozy, with all the necessary facilities (include hair dryer😌). The best part was the big balcony with great views of the mountain and beach. Watching the sunset was amazing.<br/>The homestay also did a great job of keeping noise out, making our stay very peaceful.<br/>This is totally a nice spot for beach vacation 🫶."

One small suggestion: it would be great to have a doormat in the bathroom and maybe some scented wax or spray to keep it fresh. Other than that, everything was almost perfect for me."

The second bedroom had no air conditioning, no furniture, and large intentional holes in the connecting door, completely compromising privacy and peace. There was no hot water in the shower or washing machine, despite what was advertised. The host initially lied about gym access, claiming it was closed, and only provided it after persistent requests. Worse, the host harassed us on messages to negotiate a smaller refund and sent a staff member to pressure us into accepting a cash refund instead of settling through Airbnb. This was extremely inappropriate, especially as one guest was ill. The entire stay was unprofessional and stressful."

The service provided was top-notch, and I was impressed by how beautiful and well-maintained the house was. The interior design was both modern and cozy, making it feel like a home away from home. The price was also very reasonable, offering great value for the quality of the accommodation.<br/>One of the best aspects of the location was its proximity to the beach—just a short walk away, which made it easy to enjoy the seaside whenever I wanted. The host, Cherry, was incredibly kind and accommodating. She went out of her way to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable, offering helpful tips on local attractions and dining options. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better experience, and I highly recommend Cherry's place for anyone planning a trip to Vung Tau"

The price for a better view gonna be a bit higher than the usual one (obviously). But this one just had a city view at that price. Anw, that’s just a small issue. Overall, everything is great, especially the host can ask for a better deal of renting motorbikes. And I accidentally left my power bank after we checked out and he was such a helpful guy to support that."

A swimming pool and sauna are available for free on the roof. A very nice and helpful host - he arranged for me to print the documents I needed. Thanks a lot, see you next time!

It’s a lot bigger than it seems in the pictures and the view is truly spectacular (we didn’t want to leave). Not very far to the beach - maybe 5 mins walking - and there are plenty of littler shops selling everything you need. Trang was an amazing host as well ❤️ the space had absolutely everything you could possibly need (including a washing machine !) and we really felt at home - Thank you so much ! Great value for money and we’ll hopefully be back ☺️"

She was extremely responsive, kind, and made all efforts to make sure my stay was comfortable, along with helping with local requests. The homestay was beautiful, with a nice balcony and view. The bed is comfy, the bathroom is clean and the kitchen was as functional as possible. Check-in was super easy, and it took me no time to get comfortable and let my bags down. Trang is a 10/10 host. The place I would rate an 8.5/10. The main issue I had was the noise from the construction, karaoke, and bars across the street, but this is Vietnam! It's a lively country. I got used to it, and I'm someone who has mild misophonia. There aren't any walkable convenience store locations, but it's about a 5-min grab bike to a nearby one that'll cost you 42.000 VND there and back. It's worth the ride to see the beautiful coast views on your commute. I could say much more, but this place is easily recommendable. Good vibes!"

During the weekend the buzz of people from Saigon is noticeable. Trang's place is in a calm neighbourhood with a lovely sea and mountain view. There is occasional karaoke from a nearby villa but everything is quiet after 10pm.<br/>It was my 3rd time in the building and I enjoy the area a lot. Walkable good coffee from Simon's, multiple good and affordable seafood places. Vung Tau city is just a short ride away with plenty of options in entertainment and food. <br/>Trangs place is convenient with good internet and the essential amenities. The building looks a bit older but is very convenient and quiet."

          "comments": "Linhs place is one of the nicer apartments in this building which is made up of privately owned units mostly occupied by large local families. It is 36 floors with 4 lifts 2 of which only go to the 16th floor, we waited almost 10 minutes for a lift from the 17th floor to ground level one day and regularly had to wait 5 minutes lifts were often full to bursting with one or 2 families often noisy and with very little consideration for private space. The infinity pool on the 36th floor has around 4 proper sun beds (one broken) one doesn’t adjust and 4 wicker beds not suitable for sunbathing on therefore it is almost impossible to bag a bed as the pool is usually full of very loud local families who seem to be oblivious of any around them. 8 beds for 36 floors ! Unbelievable. The gym is stocked with cheap non commercial bikes and treadmills most of which don’t work or are defective in some way. The beach is a 5 mile building site which is being completely rebuilt. There is constant noise"

Apartment is in a shade and you don't get too much sun, while having amazing view over the airport's runway. Apartment is on 17th floor. We had very good sleep here every night. Very large balcony. Elevator waiting time is the biggest weakness - building itself is huge and during holidays you have to wait a bit extra. But you get nice coworking area, nice swimming pool and even gym (a bit crowdy and small, but you still have it, in case you don't want to go anywhere else). Shopping centre Lotte is near. Beach is near. Internet is \"ok\". - anyway - we had amazing stay for 1 month."

          "comments": "Linh's place is a really lovely apartment space. The design is really nice and it's a very cosy place to stay. The pool and gym were a bonus. All communication with Linh was good. The apartment was spotless when we arrived. The balcony is nice to sit on. It was great to have cooking and laundry facilities at our disposal. The apartment complex has a convenience store which is very handy but there aren't really any restaurants in walking distance. The only inconvenience was waiting a long time for the lift, but I think this was only bad because we stayed on a public holiday and the building was especially busy. I would highly recommend a stay in Linh's place if you're looking for a cosy home away from home stay."

Her energy and warmth surround her guests from even before check in to well after . From offering great deals on excursions and scooter rentals. there was nothing she wouldn’t do for us, help us with or improve for us.The Airbnb is in an ideal location, close to everything. It’s nice to think that if I ever come back to Vung Tau — and I want to — I’ll definitely stay at her place again .  Thank you for everything Hoa. Very Highly recommended !!"

She was very understanding and flexible when my arrival time drastically changed, Gave me a tour of Vung Tau so I was more comfortable with understanding the area, and was very responsive to messages. Giving me local advice when I needed it, including a very convenient limousine bus service between Ho Chi Minh City and Vung Tau, which drops you off and picks you up from the apartment building directly. Vung Tau is a very nice place to relax at, with lots to do, There's some nice restaurants and coffee shops nearby the apartment, and the rest of the peninsula is a very short Moped / Taxi ride away (which is very affordable in Vietnam). I came here for 3 weeks to focus on some important work I had to do, And the apartment was the perfect place to do it, with the rooftop pool and local amenities to relax at when I needed a break."

The only downside is the elevator—it can be slow due to the high number of residents and tourists, but I won’t hold that against the host. All you need is a little patience. I recommend this apartment."

Vung Tao offers practically nothing. It's ok if you are a digital nomad<br/>Sea is not very nice and the pool of the building is kinda annoying because of too many controls and security watching you as you are some sort of criminal. the gym can be annoying for the same thing. the apartment it's great. it's small. and unfortunately has a room completely useless if you are 1 or 2. the place can host 4-6 ppl but would be super uncomfortable more than 2.<br/>Chau it's very helpful and give stuff you need as for example the bed was impossible to sleep on but I ask to add a toppers and she did. the only bad feeling with her is made by odd pricings. when I asked extension she gave me disproportionately price. that I didn't like. maybe English was the problem but I asked an extension and it was more expensive than booking new dates"

It’s the little things she captures that most oversee and this makes the stay that much more pleasant. <br/>Even having usb outlets in the electric sockets for charging, providing slippers to use for the pool or just walking around nearby. Kitchen was well equipped for making or having meals. <br/>Very well designed and modernized.<br/>Views are also amazing from the unit to the amazing infinity pool and gym at the 36th rooftop floor. <br/>Highly recommend."

Having said that, I do have to note that if you are looking for bars and such, I didn't find much to do at night in the area, unlike the front beach area. The area quiets down at 10pm, which, for someone who likes to walk around everywhere, it can become a little boring. <br/>Despite that, you can find what you need in your daily life close by. A big super market, a lot of restaurants and the apartment building itself hosts various cafés a convenience store and restaurants.<br/>one more thing to add, and this is more a personal preference, the mattress was a little too firm for my liking and the sofa is functional but I couldn't find a comfortable position to sit on it for long periods of time. again, this is personal preference and definitely not reflective of my overall satisfaction of the apartment which was amazing.<br/>I would definitely stay here again."

However, it must be noted that the building is absurdly crowded on the weekends and the elevator situation is comically bad. Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for the elevator if you'd like to go down during a crowded time (especially around dinner), or walk 26 floors down the stairs like we did. If you can manage that, I highly recommend this room."

The apartment's location was ideal, situated in close proximity to the beach, a big grocery store, and plenty of places for food and coffee. The host was incredibly friendly and responsive, ensuring everything was in order before and throughout my stay. The Wifi and AC worked perfectly, and the apartment, being on a high-floor, provided a stunning view of Vung Tau. If I have the opportunity to return to Vung Tau, I would certainly stay here again."

The location is convenient, with a supermarket nearby for supplies, and the full kitchen amenities were perfect for cooking meals. The shower pressure and bathroom amenities were excellent, and the aircon and fan ensured a cool and comfortable environment. The host was very responsive and kind, making the experience even better. There’s a gym onsite, which, although limited, was sufficient for a workout. While the pool’s water quality seemed a bit questionable, this is not within the host’s management or control. The lifts were busy at times, but not as bad as some previous reviews suggested. The photos online accurately reflected the property, and overall, it was a pleasant and easy stay!"

Wifi fungerer helt perfekt og man kan sagtens arbejde fra lejligheden. <br/>Lejligheden ligger dog i et meget stort lejlighedskompleks, med rigtig mange mennesker. Der er konstant kø og ventetid ved alle elevatorer. Vi var der i ferieperioden, så det skyldes muligvis dette. Derudover var der folk på gangen som løb rundt og råbte og masser af musik og karaoke i ejendommen, også om natten og tidligt om morgenen. <br/>Chau var en super vært! Meget sød og imødekommende. Hun tog imod os da vi ankom og hjalp os med finde transport da vi skulle videre. <br/>Alt i alt, lever lejligheden op til prisen."

Saimniece ir atsaucīga, ņēma vērā mūsu jautājumus, risināja tos. Tā kā šī ēka ir ļoti pieprasīta, tad var nākties ilgāk gaidīt liftu, bet nebija tik traki kā domājām. Turpat 5 minūšu gājienā ir lielisks veikals Lotte. Dzīvoklī viss nepieciešamais, lai gatavotu savu ēdienu, kā arī bija arī veļasmašīna un daudz higiēnas preces. Paldies saimniecei par rūpēm!"

          "comments": "Pros: view from above and location, host is very responsive and prompt. However, I did not understand where to meet to pick up keys. Cons: only one room key for my party of two. Very crowded building, elevators are very busy and it takes a long time most of the day (average ~10 minutes, longest 25 mins before we took stairs from the 27th floor). The room had a strong naphthalene (moth ball) smell to hide what appeared to be a vomit smell. My girlfriend mopped the living room and the smell improved somewhat. The bed linen had hair all over, we requested fresh ones and they promptly changed them. The bed blanket was also used/dirty (we changed it out). Other very basic things are lacking: there is no lamp by the bed or switch for low lights (have to get up to turn off lights, all bright or pitch black). Only two (2!) towels (bath) provided TOTAL, no bathroom mats, no hand towels, kitchen towels, etc. Walls are paper thin - get ready to hear neighbors partying loudly late at night."

We especially appreciated the quiet location, while still being just a short ride away from the local restaurants. Highly recommend this hidden gem – we’ll definitely be coming back!"

Lưu ý là nhà có muỗi, rất nhiều muỗi. Chén bát và vật dụng còn bẩn, không sạch. Hồ bơi không biết vệ sinh như nào nhưng khi tắm nước rất rất mặn gây cay mắt. Lần đầu tiên sử dụng Airbnb mà còn thu phí dọn dẹp, vệ sinh. Nói chung là trải nghiệm tệ, không vì việc trả lời nhanh gọn và quản gia thân thiện thì chắc không được đánh giá 3 sao như hiện tại."

The location is not far from Bai Dau beach and very closed to have wonderful sunset pictures of the hills & sea. The house itself is confortable to welcome families with kids or group of friends with opportunity to organize BBQ dinner by the pool.<br/>I'd recommend the place for any guest visiting Vung Tau."

The infinity pool on the rooftop was breathtaking and we could see the Vung Tau Lighthouse and Vung Tau’s Statue of Jesus the King from the rooftop. We were trying to receive a package from another city and Harmonia contacted the shop and arranged for delivery. Thank you for all of your help! We felt right at home."

She was so helpful with everything, and there's a cleaner hired to work around you which is perfect as I did spend alot of time inside the apartment as i stayed here for online study . The host also always messaged me saying 'just let me know if you need anything', she was so nice and i will be staying here again! I stayed here for 3 weeks, the pool and gym is perfect, the views are nice to distract yourself whilst your working out haha! The aircon is perfect, the bed is super comfy and the wardrobe is huge!, the tv has netflix and youtube and i enjoyed my little time outs on the sofa. The balcony has a washing line so you can hang literally every bit of washing you have. The bathroom is lovely and has plenty of storage for all your toiletries. I love the balcony and I just loved everything lol! Thanks so much, I shall be back!"

Nệm rất êm, TV có log-in sẵn netflix, máy lạnh (chắc là 2 ngựa) mát đều và ko có bị khô mũi nha, bạn mình đi chung dễ bị vấn đề về mũi khi ngủ máy lạnh nhưng tối đó ngủ siêu ngon, còn cảm thán căn airbnb này quá okie 🥰 mình hông nghĩ giá mình book hôm đó chỉ tầm 480k lại nhận đc căn airbnb ổn như vậy. Ngay trung tâm, có hồ bơi vô cực, phòng gym, sauna các thứ… trải nghiệm rất hài lòng cho 1 chuyến trip ngắn ngày ở Vũng Tàu vào dịp cuối năm ạ. Cám ơn bạn host support rất nhanh 💖"

The shower water was hot and the pressure was perfect, every time. My only two complaints were the couch had a a bit of a smell (that I’m sure can be easily removed with washing) and that there was no microwave. Two minor things that didn’t impact my stay. I would recommend every one to stay here!"

Ho apprezzato oltre che l'appartamento stupendo, assolutamente corrispondente alle foto e alla descrizione (cosa che raramente accade in Vietnam) estrema attenzione verso gli ospiti e le loro esigenze. Visto le terribili esperienze precedenti in cui la location non corrispondeva alle foto e alla descrizione, l'host ha accettato volentieri la mia richiesta di vedere l'appartamento prima di affittarlo. È sempre stato disponibile in tempi rapidissimi a rispondere alle mie richieste di informazioni, inoltre si  mostrato molto interessato a conoscerci eventuali miei bisogni o necessità per soddisfarli così come avrebbe fatto solo la mia mamma. Credo che anche solo per questa ragione l'host non abbia alcun rivale. Grazie di cuore è stato un piacere infinito ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

There's no table and chairs on the balcony so we couldn't enjoy breakfast out there and instead there was an egg chair for one person, so the two of us couldn't sit out there together comfortably. <br/>The bedsheets were not good - the material was very synthetic and it was ugly. The place would be much improved with better quality sheets. <br/>The view was okay but I would recommend finding a view from the other side. <br/>The host was really helpful, he brought us other hangers when we asked, gave us another key when asked, and was generally very responsive."

Tiện nghi đầy đủ, mới, sạch sẽ, căn ngay góc nên có cửa sổ ở tất cả phòng và toilet nên rất sáng và sạch sẽ. Có các tiện ích khác như hồ bơi, xông hơi, phòng gym,… Giá tốt cho khách đi theo gia đình.<br/>Chỉ có điều hành lang khu vực phòng mình lúc nào cũng có mùi hơi khó chịu (nghe như mùi từ hệ thống cống) và thang máy lúc nào cũng đông kín mặc dù mình đã né giờ cao điểm. Lúc check out xong tầm 12pm là đợi thang máy 30-45p mới có thể đi xuống được. <br/>Nhìn chung trải nghiệm ở đây khá ok ạ. Chỉ có những vấn đề chung của toà nhà thì chủ nhà không thay đổi được."

What I love about this place is that every room has its own door and window, unlike some other apartments. You can enjoy fresh air and a nice view of the city right from the window. Plus, the floor I stayed on had such a nice smell! I’ve been to other floors, but this one was the best. It's a great spot if you want to be near the beach and still feel cozy and comfortable."

There is a fun karaoke bar hidden beneath the building. Like a speak easy. Something you should absolutely check out if you have time one evening. If I ever have friends visiting Vung Tau I will recommend them to stay with Bien."

Nơi đây được vận hành bởi người chủ và những cộng sự rất chuyên nghiệp - tinh tế. Chúng tôi có thể tìm thấy tất cả mọi thứ cần thiết cho sinh hoạt của gia đình trong dịp đi chơi và mọi thứ rất sạch sẽ và ngăn nắp.<br/>Một điểm gia đình tôi rất vừa ý đó là những chiếc giường nệm, mền gối rất sạch sẽ và êm ái mang đến những  giấc ngủ thật sự thư giãn. Bên cạnh đó  hệ thống tỏa hương thơm và đuổi muỗi tự động trong từng phòng cũng là lần đầu tiên tôi được trải nghiệm và đây là một điểm cộng cho sự chỉnh chu, tinh tế.<br/>Tôi và gia đình đã có những trải nghiệm tuyệt vời tại đây và chúng tôi kỳ vọng sẽ tiếp tục quay lại một ngày không xa."

The caretaker, who stays at the back of the house, is very friendly as well, and cleaned the villa of trash every morning.<br/>We have stayed at several different villas in Vung Tau over the past years, but this villa was one of the best! We will surely consider coming back again.<br/>Thanks!"

Hồ bơi khá rộng, nước sạch mà không bị mùi clo làm cay mắt như những nơi khác. <br/>- 1 điểm bất ngờ nữa là dụng cụ nấu nướng, làm bếp home chuẩn bị đầy đủ như ở nhà nên buổi sáng đi bộ ra bãi biển Long Cung cách vài chục mét mua hải sản là cả ngày không cần phải tìm quán ăn , cả nhóm có thể nấu ăn và vui chơi cùng nhau cả ngày trong home. 1 cách thư giãn xả stress rất tuyệt, buổi tối mọi người quây quần bên nhau ăn uống, trò chuyện, sau đó hát karaoke chill tại home luôn<br/>- Giá phòng mình đi trong tuần nên cũng rất mềm, chia trung bình tầm 300k/ người. Đúng chuẩn đi chơi vui mà vẫn tiết kiệm luôn<br/>- Quản gia và chủ nhà hỗ trợ rất nhiệt tình"

Địa điểm gần biển, đi bộ tầm 5-7p đường nội khu là ra đến biển Long Cung.<br/>Ngoài ra, tôi cũng muốn cảm ơn chị Yến chủ nhà đã nhiệt tình đón tiếp và chu đáo tư vấn dịch vụ. Chị còn tặng chúng tôi quà mang về nữa, cực kì dễ thương và thân thiện. <br/>Tôi rất đề xuất Luck Villa là địa điểm nên đến và trải nghiệm cho kì nghỉ của gia đình"

The Song là khu căn hộ mới xây nên mọi thứ vẫn còn khá mới, xung quanh có nhiều tiện ích như trong mô tả, và khá gần biển chỉ cần đi bộ khoảng 5' là đến ngay bãi sau Vũng Tàu. Căn hộ chúng tôi thuê ở Tầng 3, và do đi trong ngày thường nên không gặp tình trạng phải chờ đợi Thang máy, tuy nhiên cuối tuần sẽ rất đông. Căn hộ của Hưng đã được chuẩn bị rất tốt trước khi chúng tôi đến, và mọi thứ rất ổn trong suốt thời gian lưu trú của cả gia đình tôi. Khi có vấn đề gì cần hỗ trợ, Hưng đều nhanh chóng trả lời."

Host is super responsive and I love that, arrived the place at 2PM and first impression was how clean the place is, nice smell of lemongrass can’t find a dirt inside the house. House has view, bright & warm, I cannot say enough about this. My dad is first time trying out airbnbs and this left him a strong impression now he wants me to book airbnbs for wherever he goes but hopefully I could get the same experience for him as this place."

We arrived early and the host tried to help us check in earlier than expected, the host responded to messages very quickly, guided us through the check-in process enthusiastically, helped us carry our luggage upstairs and was ready to provide all our needs for household items. The apartment was clean, cozy and beautiful, just as described in the pictures. Highly recommend booking here."

Có máy giặt và ban công lớn phơi đồ là một điểm cộng tuyệt vời. Chỉ có 1 nhà vệ sinh nhưng rất sạch sẽ. Xung quanh căn hộ có nhiều siêu thị tiện lợi. Bất tiện duy nhất là thang máy ở những giờ cao điểm phải đợi khá lâu, còn các khung giờ khác vẫn thoải mái; recommend cho bạn di chuyển bằng grab thì xuống sảnh hẵn đặt xe để tránh bị cancel. Anh Host support nhiệt tình 24/7. Sẽ ghé lại nếu có dịp đến Vũng Tàu."

The kids pool was easy to access and felt so nice in the humidity with its clean crisp water surrounded by greenery. The beach was super close by and I enjoyed our morning walks/runs followed by playing in the sand and water. The grocery store is sooo close around the corner and has everything you could need. It’s super safe at the song - they have security everywhere. It was so nice having a washer in the unit. The view from the balcony was quite enjoyable. AC’s worked phenomenally and best of all, the host was always so quick to respond and provide you anything you needed very promptly! He even helped me with my luggage checking in and out. Really appreciated!"

The building is safe and for the most part quiet.(there is some loud karaoke on the weekend nights, but it ends at 10pm.) For the price this is a great find would happily come back and stay here again."

We stayed here for 10 weeks and had a lovely time. <br/>The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Tip: If you're a light sleeper (like us) you might want to bring earplugs. The walls are quite thin. <br/>Huyen (host) is very responsive and helpful. We would like to thank you again for everything! ❤️<br/>We would highly recommend this apartment and would gladly stay here again!"

Phòng mình đặt kiếm không khó đâu, nằm trong 1 con đường khá thoáng và rộng rãi, xung quanh cũng có các quán kem, cà phê, tiệm tạp hoá,… khá nhiều tiện ích đấy. Nếu mọi người muốn đi tắm biển hay đến các địa điểm tham quan khác thì chỉ mất từ 5-10 phút hoặc tối đa là 15 phút chạy xe gắn máy để đến nơi nha. Anh chị chủ nhà thân thiện, dễ thương lắm nhé, anh chị hướng dẫn rất nhiệt tình về quy trình nhận/trả phòng đến việc giới thiệu các địa điểm xung quanh để mình và chị gái đi tham quan, ngắm cảnh, thưởng thức món ăn địa phương. Phòng ốc sạch sẽ, thoải mái và ấm cúng lắm, mình với chị rất hài lòng về các dịch vụ ở đây 10 điểm không có nhưng. I highly recommend this place for you all! I had such a wonderful experience here with my sister. Although the length of stay was not long (only 2 days 1 night), everything was good, fun and memorable."

Phòng rất là sạch sẽ, thơm tho lúc checkin thì host đã xông tinh dầu sẵn mình đến ngửi rất dễ chịu. Host thì nhiệt tình chủ động hỗ trợ và cũng rất thân thiện. Giờ giấc tự do thoải, ra vào homestay cũng tiện lắm. Với giá tiền mình bỏ ra thì homestay này thật sự vượt mức kỳ vọng của mình luôn. Sẽ ủng hộ tiếp nếu có dịp xuống VT ạ."

Very spacious living room, bedrooms, and bathrooms. The view from the large wraparound balcony is the best in Vung Tau. <br/>The AC, hot water, washing machine, and other listed amenities all worked great!<br/>If I return to Vung tau, I would want to stay at Emmanuel’s again. He is also a very kind host."

Chăn ga cảm giác không được sạch, nằm bị ngứa. Cửa nhà tắm không đóng được. Ngày đầu tiên còn bị thiếu cả giấy vệ sinh<br/>Khu vực rất thiếu tiện nghi. Không có quán ăn gần đó, bạn chỉ còn cách gọi đồ ăn hoặc đi taxi với khoảng cách 5 km thì mới có quán ăn. Không có bãi biển. Không có nơi có thể đi dạo<br/>Ưu điểm duy nhất là căn hộ có ban công rộng với view biển rất đẹp. Gần căn hộ có 1-2 quán cafe đẹp."

Er hat auch Termine für uns gebucht, Shuttles organisiert und Taxis gerufen. Er war wirklich überaus bemüht, dass es uns an nichts fehlt.<br/>Die Lage ost etwas abseits, wir bevorzugten die Ruhe allerdings. Er bot uns für 100.000 vnd/Tag an ein Motorbike zu mieten. Ist uns allerdings zu heikel gewesen, wegen dem Verkehr.<br/>Der Stand ist fußläufig erreichbar u man kann wunderbar entlang der Küste spazieren u Einheimische beim Fischfang beobachten.<br/>Die Unterkunft ist blitzeblank sauber und echt geräumig. Anfänglich durften wir sogar zwischen zwei Zimmern wählen. Zweimal haben wir Wäsche waschen lassen. Top Qualität.<br/>Wir können diese Unterkunft nur weiter empfehlen und würden selbst auch wieder kommen."
