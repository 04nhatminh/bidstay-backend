The location is perfect, with tons of amazing restaurants, street food stalls, and little hidden gems all within walking distance. I basically ate my way through the neighborhood.<br/>The house itself was super clean and comfortable—exactly what you want after a long day of exploring (or, in my case, eating). The host was incredibly helpful, always responsive and full of great local tips.<br/>If you’re visiting Da Nang and want a clean, convenient spot with a great vibe and easy access to incredible food, this place is a solid choice. I’d happily stay here again!"

The room and linens were spotless, the bathroom was beautiful, fancy appliances (kettle, microwave, toaster all in a beautiful retro style). And most importantly, the bicycles were almost new! Compared to the bikes at our 2 other places, these were really good condition and made our adventuring around Da Nang so easy and convenient. There are a lot of good restaurants just up the street. Location is good for nearby places like Con Market, but you will probably need to Grab to the beach. Distance from Son Tra Night market was walkable - we crossed the Dragon Bridge and it was an easy walk back. 100% would recommend for this price."

Linh was also very friendly and quick to respond to our requests. The only reason that I gave 4 stars was because the construction noise during our stay from 2-6pm that caused us to not be able to rest. Linh had construction at her place, and knowing our luck, her closeby neighbour also had construction. We would appreciate knowing this in advance whatsoever so we could be able to plan better."

It is 5 minutes walk from the Dragon Bridge and the Cham Museum, with many cafes dotting the neighborhood, making it easy to grab a coffee at almost anytime of the day.<br/>Finding it is easy. With clear step-by-step instructions, checking in is breezy. The place is clean I feel at home from the moment I stepped in. The room and bathroom are spotlessly clean with big bed and high quality mattress and pillows. As the place is not facing a main road, I had uninterrupted sleep throughout my stay.<br/>Linh is very friendly and responsive. I will definitely choose to stay here again during my future visits to Da Nang."

In fact, from this Airbnb, you could take a walk or run across the dragon bridge and around to the Cau Song Han bridge and back and it's about 5km total. Super nice!<br/>So many lovely cafes and restaurants around. My favorite cafe for Vietnamese feeling was Tiệm cà phê Cậu Út, right across the street. For working, I loved Ge or Wonderlust cafe.<br/>To the beach is only about 10 mins away by Grab bike.<br/>Linh was super responsive and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy stay in Da Nang."

Very close to the dragon bridge, and tons of storefronts and cafes! We are on a long trip around Southeast Asia, so finding a place with a large kitchen and washer/dryer combo was the highlight for us, definitely made us feel at home with all of those conveniences! The rooms are a decent size, with a private bathroom, desk, mini fridge big bed and wardrobe closet in them (and the air con works very well too!). We thought that the rooms were also pretty well spread out too, as we hardly ever heard the other guests when in them. The common space that you share with the other guests is VERY well maintained and has a homey feel to it, there is an outdoor patio on the ground floor along with a rooftop one! The instructions to get into the house are very clear, which was nice since we arrived quite late into the night. Would ABSOLUTELY recommend this spot and plan to return!"

The house feels like a home, and the host was incredibly kind and helpful throughout our stay. They went out of their way to make us comfortable and were always quick to respond. One small thing to note: there’s no hair dryer, but hopefully the host sees this and adds one soon. Overall, an excellent stay — we would definitely come back!"

          "comments": "This is the nicest apartment I've stayed at in Da Nang. It's basically brand new and is a loft style layout with floor to ceiling windows offering an excellent view of the airport, allowing you to watch the planes take off. The sound insulation is good and unlike many of the buildings closer to the beach, there are no issues with humidity/dampness.<br/>The apartment is on the top floor of a mixed-use building on a main street that makes it easy to go all the restaurants and cafes in Hai Chau. It's also really not that far from the beach side of the river either. If you want to enjoy Da Nang but not have to deal with the craziness and traffic of My An in the high season, this is a really good spot.<br/>The hosts are friendly and very responsive."

Ils ont même aménagé une belle terrasse sur le rooftop, ce qui a vraiment ajouté un plus au séjour !<br/>Le quartier est très calme, avec un environnement agréable et une superbe vue sur la mer. Et le gros avantage : la plage est à seulement une minute à pied ! Un vrai petit coin de paradis. Je recommande vivement."

I recommend going at 5:00am for the sunrise and morning swimmers. <br/>I was happily surprised that there was a little kitchenette, but u never cooked. there are little grocers all around if you did cook. <br/>the salt coffee at unicorn cyber next door was nice."

Die persönliche Begrüßung beim Check-In war sehr schön, um alles gezeigt zu bekommen und mögliche Fragen zu stellen. Auch gab es reichlich Informationen für Aktivitäten vor Ort, Restaurants und lokales Essen, was man bei seinem Aufenthalt in Da Nang probieren sollte. Die Wohnung selbst ist wie beschrieben ausgestattet, sodass man alles Notwendige vor Ort hat, was man für einen (längeren) Aufenthalt benötigt. Falls etwas fehlen sollte, ist Linh jederzeit für Hilfe erreichbar. Ich habe meinen Aufenthalt von einer Woche auf zwei Wochen verlängert, da ich mich dort sehr wohl gefühlt habe. Netterweise gab es dann einmal ein Clean-Up nach der ersten Woche, das war super! Gerne wieder und vielen Dank für alles!"

The apartment is spacious, clean, and comes with a cool projector for movie nights. Cara was also kind enough to let us check in as early as 10 AM, which we really appreciated. One of our favorite spots was the aesthetic balcony where we enjoyed our morning coffee while watching the city come to life. If you’re looking for a big, affordable place to stay in Da Nang, I definitely recommend this one!"

Place is very close to My khe beach and in the market. Laundry just opposite of the house. Nearby restaurants Tamarind Tree. Awesome food. Vegetarian food also available. Wonderful taste and services. I recommend house to stay. Whenever I back Da Nang will definitely book this house."

A lot of thins around to do and things are easy to walk to or hop on a Grab bike. There is an elevator in her home! Which makes things so easy. Just be aware this is a home and people live there, and it seems the photos posted on AirBnB are older, maybe from when they first staged the space and it was less lived in. So, the photos don't exactly match the space. Even though the space is lived in and a bit older than the photos, it is still clean and comfortable and convenient! And Thu makes the stay warm and cozy. I would definitely stay again!"

Yes, there is construction work next door but this is Vietnam so something to be expected :)  I found the construction work noise did not interfere with my stay here.<br/>Loved the room. Although not quite as sparkly as the photos, still attractive. Lots of cupboards, nice kitchenette, fabulous (marble?) floor tiles and a window to open a bit for fresh air whilst sleeping at night.<br/>Even able to get YouTube and Netflix on the TV.<br/>Already looking forward to my next stay here."

Washing is free (you also have two machines) and renting scooter went also really well. Only thing we didn’t like was that we didn’t feel welcomed by the staff working there. No smiles, no welcoming words, somehow bad mood .. and we also had the feeling they were talking about us (of course we don’t know if they talked good or bad about us, as we don’t know the language, but they were looking us up and down and chatting about us). So we didn’t feel very comfortable with them. But other than that the experience was good and it’s a really nice room!"

Alles sah aus wie auf den Bildern, ist aber deutlich in die Jahre gekommen. Das Bett war extrem hart, selbst mit Vorwarnung aus anderen Bewertungen hatten wir nicht damit gerechnet. Unser Zimmer hatte nur Fenster nach hinten zu einem gegenüberliegenden Haus – wenig Privatsphäre, auch im Bad, da man dort von dem Fenster direkt in das gegenüberliegende Bad schaut. Das Warmwasser reichte nur kurz, trotz eingeschaltetem Schalter. Die Wände sind dünn, und das „Ping“ des Aufzugs, sowie die Gespräche waren nachts ständig zu hören. Zudem ist die erwähnte Baustelle „in der Nähe“ direkt nebenan und gegenüber. Baustellenlärm war jedoch kein Problem. Bis auf etwas Staub war es sauber, und die Restaurants in der Umgebung sind sehr gut."

Еще они меня накормили что было очень важно, так как после тяжелой дороги очень хотелось кушать, а в тот момент я еще не знал где поесть. В целом семья очень дружелюбная и приветливая. Весь срок проживания я получал только комфорт и заботу от семьи Ким. Я однозначно рекомендую ее дом для проживания. Плюс ко всему мне дали кучу ценных советов, всегда были приветливы и рады моему присутствию. Спасибо большое за теплый прием! 🫶🏻"

We spent most of our time exploring the city so we didn’t use a lot of the amenities. <br/>The host was also fantastic—friendly, responsive, and attentive to our needs. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a comfortable and affordable stay."

Not only that, her energy was so friendly and we felt right at home with someone looking after us 🥺 Would definitely love to visit again when we get the chance, our stay in Da Nang was amazing thanks to her. The location was also very good, right near the beach and lots of good restaurants nearby. Thank you for a wonderful stay ❤️"

Thu was communicative, kind, and helpful throughout the process, allowing me to amend my reservation twice. <br/>I received her Airbnb as a recommendation from my friend Tim, who had previously stayed with Thu and he previously shared with me \"they were super friendly and the room was decent. It’s 2 blocks to the beach, maybe 4 to the main digital nomad cafe and restaurant area (though there’s plenty around you here too). Quiet street just off the main drag.\"<br/>I will aim to stay with Thu next time I visit Vietnam and am recommending her place to my partner, who will visit there in a couple of weeks. <br/>She seems like a very attentive and warm host and the place seems well-located to enjoy the beach and My An neighborhood."

The place was huge and spotlessly clean.   <br/>It was the perfect place for downtime before our flight… with a key board and a guitar that our teenage daughters enjoyed playing. There was also a great bahn mi stall right in front of the gate, perfect for a quick snack!  <br/>Next time we are in Da Nang, we hope to stay longer."

The host was very responsive and helpful, which truly stood out.<br/>However, several issues affected our comfort.<br/>1. The ground floor toilet's flush tank didn’t work.<br/>2. We were greeted by black ants on arrival. A dead cockroach was found in the bedroom, pointing to the need for pest control—tropical climate shouldn't be the only excuse.<br/>3. Bedroom AC units cooled slowly, and without a centralized system, the living room became too hot to enjoy.<br/>4. A dressing mirror is missing in the upper bedroom; the small one in the bathroom isn't adequate.<br/>5. Musical instruments add a lovely vibe, but the heat makes it hard to enjoy them for long.<br/>The property has great potential with its spacious layout and creative touches. With better attention to maintenance and cooling, it could easily become one of the more comfortable and enjoyable stays nearest to Airport area. Close proximity to Airport is a big plus. Thankyou 😊"

The location is unbeatable—just half a block from the market, 500 meters from the iconic pink church and close to the Dragon Bridge, and surrounded by plenty of delicious food options.<br/>The place is spotlessly clean, and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. While there are no windows or lift in the building, this is clearly mentioned in the listing and did not detract from the overall experience.<br/>For the price and location, you truly can’t find a better deal. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Da Nang!"

The place is very clean and aesthetic even better than hotels, they also has free water and amenities like toothbrush, soap etc. The room also has projector with connected smart TV. Location is also very near airport. Highly recommended to stay in Da Nang!"

The property is beautifully furnished with three spacious bedrooms, each with its own attached washroom, ensuring plenty of privacy and convenience for our big family. The home was equipped with everything we needed, and the internet connectivity was excellent throughout, which was a big plus for everyone.<br/>What made this stay extra special was the incredible hospitality of the host. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, even arranging to pick up our large family upon arrival, which was such a thoughtful gesture. Their care and attention to detail made us feel right at home, and they were always available to assist with any questions or requests.<br/>The location was also ideal — peaceful yet close to all the key attractions in Da Nang. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. 5⭐️"

The house features 3 bedrooms, 5 beds, 3 bathrooms, 1 restroom, and a beautiful kitchen and dining area that looks even better than the pictures.<br/>The house is cozy and thoughtfully designed in a modern Euro-American style, offering all the necessary amenities you could think of. The attic room, designed for children, has bunk beds and a bit of noise from the water pump, but all the other conveniences made our stay so comfortable that any minor inconvenience was quickly forgotten.<br/>The location is central, making it easy to get around, and it’s near the airport without any noise disturbance from airplanes. Every detail of the house is meticulously decorated, from the dishes and glasses to the flower vases—it’s as beautiful as a painting.<br/>The host was incredibly supportive and attentive throughout our stay. If I could, I would give her 10 stars! Highly recommended for the family or group."

Under 10 min walk to the beach, tons of restaurants and cafes nearby, and several convenience stores and a grocery store within a stone's throw. Lots of other tourists in the area, but a very laidback vibe in the neighborhood. The room is big, the bed is big and super comfy, free Netflix on TV, cold AC, a standing fan, hot water, and a full kitchen downstairs (even has a proper oven, I made pizza!) Always super easy to get a Grab bike. It's a quiet house with a free laundry machine on the roof (air dry) and weekly cleaning. I would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in Danang!

The room was spacious, and the kitchen was well-equipped with utensils and a fridge, which was very convenient. The location is perfect—close to shops and just a short walk to the beach.  <br/>The biggest highlight, however, was the communication and genuine kindness of the owners. They truly made me feel at home and ensured that everything I needed was taken care of. I would highly recommend Ciao Homestay to anyone visiting Danang!"

About 20-25 minute walk to the main DaNang beach. Plenty of local places to eat on the main road. Not quiet, there is a boxing studio downstairs, but it is one of the most quiet places we’ve had in Vietnam. The host communicates very well, even brought me a dessert for international women’s day."

We appreciated having a kitchen with clean dishes and nice appliances like a rice cooker, electric stove and large fridge with a freezer. Also there's a clothes washing machine in the bathroom. Linh was very accommodating, arranged furniture in the apartment before our arrival and helped us rent a motorbike. Location is on the southern end of the city not far either the riverfront or beach. It is a quieter part of town, but there are still plenty of restaurants within walking distance and a 24hr convenience store on the same block. You will be in good hands if you stay here the hosts are incredibly responsive and friendly. Glad we got to stay somewhere so nice for a month!"

I liked the kitchen and amenities – even a microwave oven – which is a great plus!<br/>I also liked that the bathroom had a separate place for the shower – so you don't take a shower near the toilet and have water everywhere in the floor.<br/>The bed was huge!<br/>The window doesn't look at the wall.<br/>So, I definitely recommend it!"

There's also a small but lovely balcony, perfect for enjoying a morning coffee.<br/>Linh and Binh are very attentive and professional. They helped me rent a motorbike and even shared super useful lists of places to visit via WP. I can also say they are kind and respectful people.<br/>The house is located in a developing, quiet, and safe neighborhood. As far as I know, many digital nomads and tourists stay around here. It's not super close to the beach, but I walked there a few times with no problem. Grab rides are quick and convenient anyway. Plus, being in the center of the island means you're equally close to many different spots.<br/>I was really happy with both the place and the hosts. Highly recommended!"

Приготовьтесь к тому что надо будет идти пешком до хороших кафе или ехать на такси или арендовать мопед (это можно сделать на ресепшене). На улице немного шумновато, по началу нас будили звуки с улицы по утрам, но потом привыкаешь. Внутри немного уставшая квартира, желательно скоро уже сделать ремонт."

Waking up and stepping out to the beach just across the road was an absolute delight. The location is ideal—not just for beach lovers, but also for those wanting easy access to restaurants, cafes, and local attractions.<br/>A special shoutout to Julie, our host, who made our stay even more memorable. Her attention to detail, friendly nature, and prompt assistance truly set Mercury House apart.<br/>She went above and beyond to ensure we felt at home and had everything we needed."

          "comments": "I'm torn with this response. This was a decent place - staff, location, area...We were far from the main strip where all the tourists were which is great if you want decent prices. However, sometimes you just miss the action. The scene was great, as far as the hotel itself, everything was much smaller than expected. There was a scent of mildew that came from the bathroom but if you left all the windows open throughout the day, you wouldn't have to worry about it. The beds were comfortable but took up most the space in the rooms so there was little to no room to walk around without having to jump over a bed. Walls are paper thin. The dogs outside were barking all throughout the night. The hotel barely cancels any noise but that being said, I got sound sleep. Some way, somehow. <br/>Would I stay here again?? I don't know, maybe another room? I'm not against it because I could laugh and joke about it. The locals were cool...but I'm not jumping up to volunteer to stay here again."

They offered us car service from the airport which was very affordable.  <br/>Our driver was very sweet and we did use him our first few days there.  We decided that Grab was price right for what we were doing.<br/>The hotel staff were probably some of the sweetest girls & young men I’ve ever encountered.  They were very attentive to anything we needed.  <br/>The hotel is off the beaten path were most of the tourists are , which was very nice .  We will definitely be coming back here every time we visit Da Nang!!"

Находится в пару минутах от пляжа. Бассейн хоть и маленький, но отлично подходит освежиться после жары. Персонал очень вежливый и отзывчивый. Всем рекомендую."

I contacted the host, who admitted water issues had happened before — yet still listed the unit. I requested a refund or early checkout; he refused both, then offered an “upgrade” only after I made other plans. He then came to my door unannounced and persistently knocked despite me clearly saying I was unavailable — a major privacy violation. <br/>I contacted Airbnb, and they agreed the situation was unacceptable, granting me early checkout and a 30% refund. Even then, the host sent messages and a cleaner before I had fully checked out. While the unit has potential, the handling of this situation was deeply unprofessional. <br/>I strongly advise avoiding this unit — and any others run by this host."

The apartment is quiet, there is no unnecessary noise from the road at night.  There are no mosquitoes or insects.  Cozy apartments and a good owner who is always in touch.  There is a coffee shop on the 1st floor in the morning.  Thank you."

          "comments": "Junos place is cozy and in a good location with lots of Vietnamese and Korean food around. It is around 20 minutes walk to the beach and five minutes walk to the big mall.  <br/>The room has a good size and two big beds. There is a fridge and a kettle and a little desk. The room is quite bright and has a lot of windows, but the curtains are also good to block the light at night. <br/>General issue in Da Nang seems to be the moist in the rooms, so this is not a special thing in this room, but you want to open the windows as much as you can. By doing this airflow in this room is easy, as it has windows on two sides.<br/>I recommend this apartment for your stay."

The building itself has beautiful architecture, a nice rooftop to relax on, nice walkable neighborhood and a cute cafe across the street. We stayed for an entire month and it felt just like home the entire time. Bum Junos talk was so sweet and greeted us each day when we arrived home. Everything was clean and looked just like the photos, we had lots of space and room for all our things. A big desk for me to work on my laptop as well. <br/>In Vietnam people often like to honk at night crossing even small street instersections so sometimes this would wake you if you are a light sleeper. Other than that this is a very quiet and friendly and super safe neighborhood. This is away from the Main big Street on a side street so that’s good. I’d definitely recommend staying. It’s a beautiful place, feels very secure. Had a place to park our scooter out front as well."

          "comments": "My 3-night stay with Juno was an enjoyable one, merely because it showed me an interesting side of Danang I have never seen before. That particular room ambience felt very bright and positive despite the buzzing of motor scooters is very present. The bathroom shower situation in this room is a bit tricky. You would have to use his shower slippers provided to shower first, then ideally open the windows to let the floor get dry first (90 min) if you prefer to reenter the bathroom in a dry state. If you’re showering first, and need to go in again immediately after (like me), it’s a good idea to keep the shower slippers adjacent to the bathroom door. The pool is sadly neglected (not clean for proper use), which didn’t stop me from enjoying the view and ambiance from his cute rooftop. Many reviews only mentioned Juno and Bom, but there are more interesting family members to encounter, in fact, there is one that looks almost identical as Juno :-)"

Juno had sent some very useful instructions which helped us find the place easily.<br/>The room was good - clean & with all necessary amenities. Since I stayed for only 1 night, didn’t get a chance to explore the neighbourhood.<br/>Special shoutout to Juno for being the best AirBNB host I’ve come across :)<br/>Although we reached so late in the night, he stayed awake and received us in person.<br/>I was travelling with my grandmom - Juno very considerately reallocated our room from the 3rd to the 1st floor so she didn’t have to climb a lot of stairs ( and I didn’t even request him to do this! )<br/>We had quite some luggage - he helped us in moving it to the 1st floor.<br/>Although my visit was short, I can totally vouch for Juno - an incredibly kind and warm host ♥️"

The bed was very comfortable, which was a rare find during our trip. It truly felt like home – clean, cozy, and with a lovely room setting that made us feel relaxed from the moment we arrived. Hot water was available to shower. <br/>The host was very responsive. For the price, this homestay offered amazing value. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, homey, and convenient place to stay."

It is at the end of a rather long, narrow alley and there is no way to be dropped off at the door with luggage. I suggested having two positions to hang the bathroom mirror as it is far too low for an adult male North American. Working around the door in the bathroom is a bit of a nuisance, but considering how little I paid, I just accepted it."

The location was perfect close to local marts, Indian restaurants walkable distance , and massage parlours, making it easy to enjoy the city. <br/>Beach was literally a 5min walk🫶🏻<br/>The host was responsive and thoughtful, arranging a scooter for us in advance so our itinerary went smoothly from the moment we arrived. <br/>She also went above and beyond by organizing our airport pickup and drop-off, which made our trip hassle-free.<br/>The apartment was well-equipped, with a kitchen stocked with all the essentials for guests. <br/>The laundry setup was convenient and included a compact drying area that worked perfectly. <br/>Overall, a fantastic stay with a host who truly cares about her guests. <br/>Highly recommended!"

Since it's near the school you might hear kids playing around and school bells but it's not really an issue. <br/>The room got cleaned and towels were changed to fresh ones after a couple of days which was awesome. It was also great that there's a washing machine available and there's a clothes line where you can dry your washed clothes! Did I mention that it's a few minutes away from the beach? Overall great choice for a place to stay."

The staff and housekeeper were very friendly and the room was cleaned in the middle of my stay which was appreciated.  The only issue was the last couple of days someone checked into the unit above and they were very noisy constantly dragging chairs across the floor and loud stomping which made it difficult to concentrate on work or get sleep at night."

The suite is located at the Golden Bay hotel, it has a couple places within the hotel where you can get coffee and it has a small convenient store.<br/>The hist met us at the lobby and helped us with our luggage, showed us the room and was friendly. <br/>The unit offered a small fridge, plates, glasses and a kettle.  Bottled water was also provided. The pool located on the 29th floor has an incredible  view of Da Nang. Over all we had a fantastic time and would recommend this Airbnb. Location was good for us as we did not want to be right downtown, city is easy to navigate and very accessible."

Unit comes with 2!!! Refrigerators.  So u r build for a long term stay and a convenient one. The area felt quite but safe.  From here we ventured to our daily tours.  <br/>A real luxurious stay for a minimal cost.  Rooftop is romantic to stay on. Have a drink and view the world from the 29th floor.  We stayed there a couple of time.  Not to mention the Infiniti pool.  One of a kind hotel.  The unit is new. Bath tub is large new and. Lea and so is everything else. Sheets were white clean and nice. Bed was excellent. I can not say even one unflattering word.  You must try this place. <br/>And the host was friendly, helpful, available and there when you needed here. Even at our 5:30 am departure. <br/>Thank you. <br/>One of a kind."

Besonders positiv hervorzuheben ist das freundliche und hilfsbereite Personal, das jederzeit für Fragen und Anliegen zur Verfügung stand. Die Lage ist etwas außerhalb, aber dennoch gut erreichbar, sodass es kein Problem war, die Umgebung zu erkunden. Insgesamt eine tolle Unterkunft mit einem fairen Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis – ich würde sie auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und gerne wiederkommen!"

They even gave me a list of go-to places to eat ❤️ They clean the rooms every day and they change the towels too. The room was spacious and you can connect your phone/device to the TV and speaker. Even if it's beside the street, I didn't get bothered by the honk of the cars early in the morning (well, I worked at around 5am so I'm wide awake when they start coming! so if you're sensitive to the bustling noise of traffic, maybe request a room that's not facing the street. overall, I loved my stay and would definitely book here again when I come back to Da Nang ❤️"

Mong sắp tới home có chuẩn bị thêm một số đồ cho nữ (như vài miếng bông tẩy trang, tăm bông ráy tai)."

What made the stay memorable, moreover, was interacting with Thuong at the front desk. She was incredibly friendly and helpful, enhancing my stay with her local tips and suggestions.<br/>I did use the corrections that other guests made in their reviews for the GRAB address, which was helpful!<br/>The room itself was immaculately clean and well-equipped, making for a homely experience. The only minor hiccup was a slight odor in the washing machine. I'd suggest a cleaning to ensure a perfect experience for future guests. <br/>Overall, this was a delightful stay. A big thanks to Thuong and the apartment for adding such a wonderful chapter to my journey in Vietnam !"

Thương was there to answer all of my questions (and I had many) and was helpful the entire time I was at the Airbnb... Thank you Thương! You are amazing. You made me feel so comfortable in Da Nang.<br/>The studio is not very far from the beach. Maybe 3 blocks/ a 10-15 minute walk (even less if you walk fast).  It is farther north of downtown Da Nang, so you may need to get a ride. Otherwise,  it would be a very long walk (maybe a half hour/45 minutes) or you could rent a Scooter they conveniently have available.<br/>The balconey is cute (quite cozy) and the washing machine lives on it. I had difficulties with the washing machine. I suggest if you plan on using it to talk to Thương or whoever is at the main desk first so they can guide you. The balconey has a view of a mountain in the distance, and cute backyard of another building.<br/>Wifi works great. AC works great. Check-in and check-out was quite easy. Nice amenities!"

Also the closet doesn’t have anywhere to hang the clothes and the floor was dirty upon check in. The bathroom is very awkward with no counter space and the shower head is nearly directly on top of the sink. Also the mattress still has its plastic cover when purchased so it is not as fluffy or comfortable as to be expected. The amenities listed were correct, as the wifi worked well and the tv had Netflix on it."

I'd say it's more like a hotel room with a private bathroom than an apartment. When we stayed the construction next door wasn't noisy at all. Equipment as described - a kettle, a minifridge, a TV with Netflix and a shared free washing machine on the top floor. Hot water and shower pressure are great, wi-fi good too. There's always someone helpful at the reception during the day and communication via messages is fast and proactive. When we arrived, the floor wasn't very clean but when they did housekeeping the next time, it was spotless, so hopefully just a one-off. Easy to find and we were able to do an easy self check-in after a night bus. Good location - a short walk to the beach, shops, restaurants and a longer but nice walk along the river to the Dragon bridge. A good deal for Da Nang, would stay again."

We even ended up skipping some of our tours just to relax at the beach & pool. This is a luxury hotel and we felt lucky to book it while still enjoying the same amenities as hotel guests. We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights, but honestly, it felt too short. I wish we had adjusted our itinerary and stayed longer.<br/>Even though I knew the king-size bed might be a bit tight for the 3 of us, I still chose this place because it’s a beachfront  at a very affordable price. It would have been nice if there was a sofa bed, though.<br/>There were some minor issues like the room key card not working, getting charged for a towel that got stained & a small hiccups when our Grab dropped us off at the hotel entrance we weren’t informed that our lobby was in the last building. But all of these were outweighed by the overall wonderful experience at Wyndham Resort and I still give it a 5 star rating⭐️"

I was warmly welcomed with complimentary coffee — although I’m allergic to caffeine, I truly appreciated the kind gesture.<br/>The room was very new and clean, and the overall atmosphere of the resort was peaceful and private, located right by the beach. One small note is that guests need to bring their own towels when going to the swimming pool, and the washing machine couldn’t dry my clothes — or perhaps I didn’t know how to use it properly.<br/>Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would love to come back again if I have the chance."

Even the laundry across the street was cheap, amazing and delivered free of charge. Would (and will) stay here again!"

Yes the bathroom can flood a little but stick a towel down and it’s fine, showers lovely, plus they clean everyday so you’ll get a new towel so it’s not an issue. Staff at the hotel were amazing and the location is bang on. Rooftop gym and pool are an added bonus I used it everyday and rarely saw anyone else up there. It’s a cracking place and great price thanks"

The atmosphere was fresh and welcoming.<br/>What really made the stay stand out, though, was the staff. She was genuinely helpful, friendly, and went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. You can really tell they care about their guests.<br/>Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a smooth, relaxing, and comfortable stay!"

The property is in a fantastic spot with beautiful scenery. However, we noticed mold on the ceiling and inside the AC vents, which was concerning. Amenities are available, but you’ll need to pay extra as they are primarily for hotel guests. Overall, the location was excellent, but the mold stains made us a bit uneasy."

They went out of their way to accommodate a super late check in time, and made it stress free for me to get in at around 1am (not all airbnbs in this area will do this!). <br/>The room itself was clean, modern, and had great AC. But of course the best part is the balcony overlooking the waterfront - the view is just amazing to wake up to each morning! There’s a small set of patio furniture on the balcony so that you can sit outside and enjoy the space outside as much as possible. In my opinion, having stayed in a lot of hotels in Da Nang, this airbnb wins hands down for affordability, cleanliness, and value. There’s also the rooftop swimming pool where you can order drinks and enjoy the beautiful views! Would highly recommend this building to others who are seeking a conveniently located, beautiful space to vacation :)"

Our family had a very comfortable and satisfying stay here. It’s only a few minutes’ walk to the beach.<br/>A very minor downside is that the bathroom in our room didn’t have an exhaust fan, so there was an odor. The lighting setup around the sink area wasn’t ideal, making it a bit inconvenient for getting ready or doing makeup, the light wasn’t bright enough and caused glare when looking in the mirror. However, these are just small issues and didn’t really affect our overall experience. If we have the chance to visit Da Nang again, our family will definitely choose to stay here again!"

Với tầm tiền này thì mình thấy ở home thoải mái hơn khách sạn nhỏ. Home giới thiệu có Chi nhánh 2 gần chi nhánh 62 Nguyễn Thái Học có thang máy mới hơn. Mng có thể tham khảo"

The only minor downsides were that the bed felt a bit too firm for my liking and there was some street noise during the day. However, things quieted down nicely by 9 or 10 PM, allowing me to sleep peacefully. Overall, a great experience! 🤙"

They also provide slippers to wear inside. <br/>The location was very central and convenient (next to Han market), making it easy to get to every where. Highly recommend to rent a motorcycle. <br/>Host was responsive, respectful and friendly, which made the experience even better. <br/>One cons is the room on the 4th floor and the old cleaner lady had to helped me bring it up there since theres no lift. Its a no if you are heavy packed <br/>They also let me early check in with 30% extra fee which is fine."

Из минусов: шум, ремонт за стенкой в 8 утра (я не могла спать), неприятный запах так как в ванной нет вытяжки. Это запах очень стойкий и не выветривается, если открыть все окна. <br/>Я поставила 5 звезд так как приятный дизайн и свежий ремонт за относительно небольшую стоимость."

From the moment I made my reservation, the staff were incredibly kind and attentive. I especially want to compliment the reservation team for their outstanding hospitality, they were responsive, friendly, and made me feel genuinely cared for even before I arrived.<br/>What really impressed me was how thoughtful they were with my request for a bike rental. I had mentioned it briefly during my booking, and to my delight, everything was already arranged by the time I checked in. The bike was ready, in excellent condition, and the staff even provided helpful suggestions for scenic routes around the area. It’s clear they pay attention to the little details that make a big difference."

We were originally supposed to arrive on the 26th, but ended up arriving late on the 27th. It was a tough travel day, and we were really exhausted and stressed.<br/>The host was incredibly kind and flexible. Even though our stay was shorter and we would be checking out early, he still offered us a discount. That thoughtful gesture really meant a lot to us and showed how much he cares about his guests.hospitality and understanding made a big difference during our trip. We truly appreciate everything and would absolutely recommend staying here to anyone visiting Da Nang. Looking forward to coming back under better circumstances for a longer stay"

Phu’s Airbnb in Da Nang isn’t just a place to stay—it’s a full experience, and one that left me feeling both grateful and a little sad to leave behind. Whether you’re a solo traveler, a digital nomad, a couple, or a small group exploring Vietnam, this spot delivers comfort, charm, and genuine hospitality in a way that’s rare to find.<br/>Location, Location, Location<br/>Set right in the heart of Da Nang, the location alone makes this Airbnb worth booking. You’re within walking distance to so many great restaurants, night markets, cafes, and cultural spots. The area feels lively but not overwhelming—just the right mix of convenience and comfort. Whether I wanted to grab local street food or take a stroll to the ocean, everything was nearby. It’s central without the chaos, and that’s a big win.<br/>The Space<br/>The rooms are beautifully designed—clean, minimal yet"

          "comments": "Phu’s place is as described and photographed. It’s a small one bedroom apartment, centrally located where there are lots of restaurants and bars around the area, while the beach is a few min walk away. Despite its location and that there is a bar right across the street, this unit is quiet at night as it is at the back side of the building and faces another building. The downside is that it does not get a lot of sunlight during the day but I take that over noisy nights. There is a coffee shop on the ground floor that you have to walk through to get to the elevator but it was not an issue for me. <br/>Thanks for the great stay."

The location is central (and super convenient), but once you get in your airbnb, you can’t hear any sounds and it’s peaceful (10/10). The host and staff are polite, helpful and very proactive! Highly recommend this!"

Ultimately, great space as it has a dining area, kitchen, bathroom, and large bedroom space. <br/>Host is very responsive: morning, afternoon and night. <br/>Nomads: every 5 hours the router may go dark but no worries just unplug and plug it back in. If I had a long string of meetings up ahead I would simply restart the router proactively  and the internet works great all throughout. It’s a fast wifi. And again, if anything happens — you just restart the router, and it’s back on within 30 seconds. Restart it at the beginning of your shift and nothing will happen for at least the next  5-6 hours so it’s honestly nothing to worry about. <br/>This is a great space, highly worth the money. I do recommend."

I would recommend it to someone who also works remote, his wifi at Lu Coffee downstairs is also really fast more than 200mbps, wifi inside the room is around 80mbps which is also spectacular. Quiet, has a laundry area, and you can also cook. There are lots of restos nearby. Check in and check out was smooth. Mr. Phu (as we call him) is very down to earth and he is very responsive to your chats whenever you have questions. Your room also gets cleaned every other day. The lady maintaining is friendly too. I’d definitely recommend this out to people who likes a spacious room plus reliable internet for work!"

If any issues came up, he addressed them right away, which I really appreciated.<br/>The property is conveniently located above a cool coffee shop, making it easy to grab a drink, get some work done, or just relax.<br/>One suggestion for improvement would be to add more kitchen items, such as extra plates, bowls, glasses, utensils, and maybe a blender.. While the current setup is sufficient, a few additional items could make it even better.<br/>Aside from the noise from construction nearby—which was beyond anyone’s control—my stay was nearly perfect.

The only thing we noticed was a strong cleaning product smell in the room - I’m sensitive to strong chemical scents and would’ve struggled if we stayed more than a night but others might not even notice it."

The sauna and pool was such a nice bonus as well and I think I used it almost everyday. The room was also very clean and we had room service clean our room twice a week. The location was also perfect and had everything within walking distance such as cafes, restaurants, or the beach. Lastly, the staff was above and beyond and the hospitality was simply amazing. We will be back again when revisiting da Nang."

For an Airbnb they cleaned our room daily, with free water, fresh towels and the staff are very friendly and accomodating. The location is a few mins walk from Da Nang Beach. There are a lot to do within the area and very good restaurants nearby. Plus we love that it's near a very good coffee shop that we go daily in the morning (Wind coffee shop). I plan to go back here next year and will reccomend this place to all my friends and family. They have a cute dog in the lobby! Hello Kiki! would like to commend their staff as well who made our stay hospitable and efficient. Raymond and the lovely lady who welcomed and help us throughout our stay thank you! See you soonest 💛💛💛"

They truly go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We especially enjoyed chatting with Hoàng (Raymond), who was incredibly friendly and interesting to talk to — we’ve definitely made a friend for life!<br/>The only suggestion I’d make is to consider adding mosquito nets in the rooms. With the pool nearby, there were quite a few mosquitoes, and we ended up with several bites. But aside from that, everything was great.<br/>Thank you for having us 🥰"

Location wise it is about a 5 to 10 minute walk to Danang beach area, with mini-markets about 3 minutes away (to buy snacks / water etc.) which is very convenient. <br/>What stood out is the reception (they helped check us in and also with our bags to the room). Reception is very welcoming, friendly and helpful and allowed an earlier check-in which is great as we arrived about 2 hours early (1pm vs. 3pm). The reception also helped guide us to local food areas and even took a family picture (printed with frame) as a parting gift. Thank you!<br/>The only small downside is the room is as per pictures, a little small, but we didn't really stay long in the room so it suited us perfectly."

(You're better off renting out the downstairs unit in that case.)<br/>- It was a bit tight for 6 people (2 people to a bed). But this is reflected in the cheaper price."

The location was ideal—just minutes from My Khe Beach and surrounded by local cafes, convenience stores, and local dining spots. We loved exploring the neighbourhood’s Vietnamese flavours while having all the comforts of home. Getting around was not a hassle coz Grab (Asia's Uber) was just a click away.<br/>What truly made our stay special was our wonderful host, Linh! She helped us arrange tickets and transportation to Ba Na Hills, and offered great local tips. Her hospitality made our trip so much smoother and more enjoyable.<br/>Highly recommend for anyone visiting Đà Nẵng—great value, prime location, and exceptional host!"

It’s not too far to walk to the My Khe beach (about 5 minutes). Nearby, there is a great BBQ restaurant called Veteran, and I also like the local shop nearby. The weather has been a bit rainy, but fortunately, the host thoughtfully provided umbrellas for us to use for walking. I would recommend this apartment to any friends visiting Da Nang. It’s a place worth experiencing for a trip."

There are cafés, restaurants and juice shops in the area and it is very quiet. The room is clean, has natural light, a kitchen and a very small balcony. Phuoc is very friendly and responds very fast if you need anything. Also the people cleaning the room are very friendly! There is a washing machine and a terrace for shared use. We enjoyed our stay."

The apartment features stunning city and coastal views since it sits on the corner of a high floor.  The host was very kind and responsive.  There is a small supermarket next door should you require any late night snacks or drinks.  The beach across the street is perfect for swimming.  The water is very clear and you will see fish and other marine life swimming about you.  I enjoyed my stay here and will be back soon."

The location was perfect and the staff? Absolutely AWESOME. I typically don’t need much help when I travel since I’m very self-sufficient, but the team went above and beyond—truly top-notch hospitality.<br/>That said, I was really disappointed to find out that the gym and pool—two key reasons I chose this property—were not accessible during my stay. Unfortunately, I wasn’t informed ahead of time, and I was actually escorted out of the gym by a Signature employee, which was pretty embarrassing. As a travel blogger, I had content scheduled around those amenities, so a heads-up would’ve saved me time, money, and a good amount of frustration.<br/>Still, the view, the location, and the staff were all on point. I can't justify giving a lower rating because everything else was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again —but"

The convenience factor was outstanding - the neighborhood offers numerous mini markets, charming coffee shops, and various restaurants to explore. We were pleasantly surprised to find a bus station nearby that connects to the iconic Dragon Bridge in only 10 minutes.<br/>The accommodation itself was immaculate, fully equipped with all necessary amenities that made us feel completely at home. Chan was an exemplary host - incredibly helpful and maintaining excellent communication throughout our stay. We wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone visiting Da Nang!"

We felt much more comfortable - the place was exactly as pictured and described. We are also very grateful for the host to quickly accommodate our request. There is construction in the morning, but we had to wake up early anyways, so it wasn't a big deal. Overall, I highly recommend!"

It's clean, good AC, comfy bed, I was offered cleanings for the apartment, nearby a lot of great restaurants within a 10-15 walk. Host is very responsive.<br/>Only minor complaints are there's no detergent for the washer, but Young Chan was able to get me enough for 1-2 loads so don't be afraid to ask. Also, the building next door just started construction and was awakened at 6AM, keep that in mind if you're sensitive to noise. This is out of the owners control, so I don't blame them."

Двери открываются по карточке, а парковка для байка внутри дома, в парадной.<br/>Постельное бельё синтетическое.<br/>Хотя кухня и есть, на ней нет соли и масла. Так что даже если приезжаете на один день и хотите приготовить что-то, придется покупать масло и соль самостоятельно. <br/>Вытяжка уходит просто в шкаф, надеюсь хозяин доделает."

          "comments": "L’appartement est joli, bien décoré, conforme aux photos et bien équipé, ce qui est appréciable. Cependant, plusieurs points ont affecté la qualité de notre séjour. L’environnement est extrêmement bruyant, avec des travaux à proximité et une très mauvaise isolation phonique. Le bruit est constant, de jour comme de nuit, ce qui rend le repos très difficile.<br/>La salle de bain présente de nombreuses traces de moisissure, ce qui donne une impression de manque d’entretien. De plus, la pression de l’eau est très faible, et il est compliqué d’obtenir de l’eau chaude de façon stable, ce qui peut être particulièrement inconfortable.<br/>Concernant l’emplacement, il est à environ une heure de marche du centre-ville. Cela ne nous a pas dérangés car nous aimons marcher, mais c’est un point à prendre en compte. La plage est heureusement très proche (5 minutes à pied)."

Besonders gut war das Bett, sehr gemütlich und einladend! Die Küche war groß und man hatte viel Platz + einige Dinge wie Kaffee, Wasser, Tee und Nudelsuppen standen bereit. Leider fand ich das Bad nicht ganz so toll, sehr eng und beim duschen wurde alles inklusive Toilette nass. Nach einem Tag roch es etwas muffig, weil man nur über die Balkontür lüften konnte (was abends aber zu laut war) Die Strandnähe war super und man ist mit dem Taxi oder Grab schnell in die Innenstadt gekommen. Die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich! ACHTUNG: Karaoke-Bar in der Nähe, es kann abends mal lauter werden!"

The room was very new, impeccably clean, and cozy, with modern decor and comfortable furniture. It was the perfect space for the two of us to relax and unwind, complete with thoughtful touches like natural lighting that brightened the room beautifully and a warm atmosphere. We also loved the rooftop, which offered a stunning view of the mountains—absolutely breathtaking! The owners were so friendly, making our stay even more enjoyable. We loved it and would definitely return!"

The street outside is sometimes a little noisy, but it’s not that big of a deal. Wifi and AC both work well, and Phước is a very proactive and helpful host. It’s certainly worth the money, and a good spot if you’re looking for an inexpensive option that still has everything you need."

Ngoài ra, chúng tôi còn được 1 ly đồ uống rất ngon nữa. Không những thế, giặt đồ hoàn toàn miễn phí. Điều này đỡ cho chúng tôi rất nhiều khoản chi phí ( vì tôi mang không nhiều quần áo ha ha )<br/>Đây chính là kì nghỉ hè đáng nhớ nhất của tôi. Cảm ơn Coco Villa 6 và Trang đã cho tôi 1 kì nghỉ hè tuyệt vời."

Еще тут  мягкая кровать, что редкость для недорого жилья. Хозяин любит свои квартиры и следит за ними, так же помогал мне, если чего-то не хватало: приносил утюг, отдельный подододеяльник. Клиент после меня приезжал позже, поэтому мне дали 2часа дополнительно отдохнуть в аппартаментах. Wifi был с хорошим сигналом, письменный стол и кровать очень удобные, напор воды в душе хороший и вода быстро уходила в слив, ванная комната не была мокрой. Фото полностью соответствуют квартире, столовые приборы, посуда. Какие-то кафе и магазины с аптеками есть в 5-7 минутах ходьбы. Легко вызвать такси до центра и больших супермаркетов, в среднем 22 000 донгов. Квартира стоит своих денег однозначно. Хотя я придирчива, поэтому укажу минусы: нет розеток в ванной комнате и продлить бронь нельзя, все недорогое занято 😄 Бронируйте сильно заранее, за 10дней хотя б!"

The room was also surprisingly peaceful despite the busy neighborhood, except for one night when other guests were partying in a nearby room. The photos are very inaccurate and should be fixed, however the room was bigger than in the photos and despite being slightly worn, was actually quite comfortable."

The woman at reception was so lovely, she went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable- she even changed my TV because the one in the room wasn’t working, which I really appreciated! She is a joy to speak to! You could barely hear any noise from outside despite it being in a very central busy area! 5 minutes walk to the beach too. The only ‘con’ is you can hear when people are in the corridor, and sometimes the other guests and the cleaners were quite loud, especially in the early morning. Maybe a reminder to everyone to be mindful of how echoey it is would help. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my stay and I would stay again. Extremely good value! Thank you ☺️"

The building is new so no issues with mold or cockroaches as I’ve heard from other travelers who’ve had those issues in other apartments. About 5 min walking distance from the beach. Grocery stores and pharmacies near by. There’s a washer and drying rack in the roof but there’s also laundry services near by as well. AC works great. Overall very clean and maintained apartment. The host and his staff were very accommodating during my long stay here 😄. Would definitely stay here again if I come back to Da Nang."

The room is very nice and spacious, and it had everything I needed; a wonderful kitchen with lots of utensils and a huge fridge, a very large and comfortable bed, table and chairs, balcony, and very reliable WiFi. The host was very responsive, proactive, professional, helpful and kind. On the ground floor there is a shop and that was very convenient. It had everything I needed like water, milk, fruit, chocolates, and a lot more. There is also a washing machine. The location is superb. Very close to the beach, with many restaurants,  shops, and pharmacies nearby. I had a wonderful stay and I definitely recommend. The beach is absolutely gorgeous."

Highly recommended!<br/>관리진과 직원들은 정말로 뛰어납니다. Airbnb 앱을 통한 그들의 소통은 뛰어났으며, 항상 기대 이상으로 최선을 다해주었습니다.<br/>다낭을 처음 방문하는 분이든 다시 방문하는 여행자든, 꼭 이곳을 체크아웃해보세요. 위치는 그야말로 최고입니다—해변까지 단 2분 거리에 있으며, 많은 레스토랑과 바가 가까운 도보 거리에 있습니다.<br/>저는 이곳에서의 경험에 너무 만족해서, 더 많은 사람들이 이 멋진 장소를 발견할 수 있도록 이 리뷰를 한국어와 일본어로 작성하고 있습니다. 강력 추천합니다!"

Too long to walk from the airport with all the luggage (it looks right next door on the map, but the path for pedestrians winds all the way around), so just pay $2 for a grab. <br/>Excellent host & room was as described. All staff were very friendly & helpful. <br/>The only knock would be that the bathroom window didn't have a screen (none of the windows in Vietnam do), so your options were to either be eaten alive by mosquitoes (I got some big bug bites my first night; not a great way to start the trip) or not properly vent the bathroom. There was no fan and the window to the bathroom was facing the hall/main staircase of the homestay so people in other rooms or walking by above can see and hear inside your bathroom. <br/>Binh was super helpful and responsive."

The location was perfect, with stunning views and easy access to the beach. The apartment was impeccably clean, beautifully decorated, and equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Huynh was incredibly welcoming and provided excellent recommendations for local restaurants and attractions. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Da Nang.

If you are into hiking, you can go to Lady Buddha, and local trails. Studio is spacious and clean, however the kitchen needs some upgrades. If you like to cook at home you will need extra utensils. The neighborhood is safe, but can get loud when locals sing karaoke. It might be the same in any parts of Vietnam though, because people love to sing."

They provided many helpful local recommendations and tips. I liked the location, it was a bit away from the main touristy areas (which were also still easily accessible). But I preferred the local restaurants and cafes over the more tourist-oriented spots. Already miss a few of my favourites! The locals were so nice and their food was incredible. The market nearby was a plus. And a quick walk to the beach to watch the sunrise in the mornings was a real treat! 👌 I would happily stay again."

The location is fantastic- a short walk from the beach, grocery stores, restaurants, spas and everything you need. The apartment is in a prime location but it’s also quiet and peaceful. <br/>The hosts were absolutely amazing. The reception downstairs made me feel very welcome. I use this app every month and these ladies were some of the nicest, most accommodating hosts I’ve ever had. 10/10 would recommend if you are a solo traveller like me visiting Vietnam for the first time."

Phuoc was a great host. He met me right when I arrived to help show me how to get into the apartment and other things I should know. They came in to clean the apartment halfway through my stay which was great! The shower was amazing with a waterfall head, detachable head, and a foot one as well. The apartment was conveniently on the first floor so it was nice to not have stairs, though people walking on the street can see into the apartment. I would recommend!"

Mình nhận phòng gần 11h30 tối nhưng vẫn được host trực tiếp đón và hỗ trợ nhận phòng nhanh chóng, giới thiệu các địa điểm gần toà nhà. Có máy giặt, sấy, chỗ phơi đồ. Phía dưới toà nhà có quán nước giá rất bình dân. View tầng thượng nhìn ra núi Sơn Trà, sông Hàn, toà nhà hành chính, cầu Thuận Phước lung linh khi về đêm... gần đường Nguyễn Công Trứ với rất nhiều món ngon và giá bình dân. Tuy nhiên áp lực nước trong phòng tắm cần cải thiện hơn. Ngoài ra mọi thứ rất ok."

From a smooth check-in to giving local recommendations, she ensured I had a hassle-free experience.<br/>The location is great, just a 15-minute walk to Da Nang Beach with plenty of cafes, shops, and attractions within walking distance. The area felt safe and the property was neat and clean. Having a kitchenette was a plus and the workstation helped me manage my work efficiently.<br/>As a Superhost myself, I could truly appreciate the effort and attention to detail the team has put into making this stay comfortable for guests.

There is a tree in the garden/balcony area, which I really respect that they kept it instead of cutting. <br/>The best thing about the place is the host and her team. They are super supportive, always responsive, and taking care of the place and the guest well. <br/>As a huge plus, they are open to suggestions to make the experience better for the guest. A great stay."

The room is on the first floor and comes with a private bathroom equipped with a bidet and hot/cold shower. They provide basic toiletries like a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, and fresh towels, which is really convenient. The kitchen is spotless and fully stocked with cooking tools if you want to prepare meals. It’s just a short walk to the beach and about a 10–15 minute drive to Da Nang City Center. The host offers motorcycle rentals, making it easy to get around. They were very accommodating, quick to respond, and shared great recommendations for food, activities, and local spots. The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful, and feels very safe. Overall, this is a great place to stay if you want comfort, convenience, and helpful local insight. Highly recommended!"
