There are tons of restaurants and cafes around too. Not too crowded, just nice and comfy. The staff are super friendly, there’s a free washing machine, and you can hang out on the rooftop. Loved everything about it, plus it’s really affordable. Thanks! I’ll definitely be back when I’m in HCM again."

Phòng kế hoặc bên trên nói gì là nghe như kế bên ồn không ngủ được luôn. Đi lại thôi mà cũng ồn nữa. Với lại mình thấy phòng san sát mà hẹp không biết có an toàn mảng Pccc ko vì toàn là gỗ có sự cố ko biết sẽ thế nào. Cửa rất khó đóng và còn bị hư mình đóng lại r mở không dc may mà chị chủ nhà nhiệt tình hỗ trợ. Giá rẻ vị trí cũng tốt."

The rooms were simple and small  but they were affordable, came with all the essentials and were exactly as described on Air BnB. Rooms were also very clean! It was really nice to have my own space. I wanted to have some time away from socialising at hostels and this was exactly what I needed. <br/>Quang also offered a deal with giving a discount at his wife’s dentist. Coincidentally I had a dental emergency and Quang was very helpful in getting me a last minute appointment. Thank you very much! I will be coming again if I am in HCMC in the future."

Das gesamte Haus hat viel zu bieten: Es gibt ein schön bepflanztes Dach, das man nutzen kann, einen sauberen Pool und insgesamt ist es angenehm ruhig und sogar barrierefrei!<br/>Das Badezimmer war selten belegt und hatte eine sehr gute Dusche – in Vietnam keine Selbstverständlichkeit. Auch das Zimmer selbst war sehr praktisch eingerichtet: Es gibt einen Schreibtisch, genug Ablagefläche und kostenloses Trinkwasser zum Nachfüllen. Ich konnte flexibel ein- und auschecken, was mir sehr geholfen hat.<br/>Der Gastgeber war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Er hat mir interessante Einblicke in sein Business gegeben und mir sogar ausgeholfen, als ich kurzfristig ein Problem mit meiner Bank hatte – dafür bin ich sehr dankbar.<br/>Ein kleiner Verbesserungsvorschlag wäre vielleicht eine zusätzliche kleine Lampe im Zimmer neben dem Bett zu installieren."

Their hospitality and warmth really stood out and made us feel right at home. The space itself was comfortable, clean, and perfectly located, but it was their kindness that truly made the difference. We couldn’t have asked for a better hosts, and we’d happily return in the future. Highly recommend!"

The host responded quickly and provided super helpful instructions.<br/>There are tons of charming cafés and local shops around, all within a comfortable walking distance.<br/>And even though it’s right in the center of District 1, the place was incredibly quiet at night. I especially loved the lighting in the room after sunset. It created such a peaceful vibe that I had the most restful sleep.<br/>Would I come back? Absolutely!"

Có máy giặt trên sân thượng và chỗ để xe dưới hầm (phải dùng hệ thống cầu nâng). Sạch sẽ, thoải mái. Giao tiếp với host vô cùng dễ dàng và hữu ích."

Hanh was a very responsive host and helpful throughout the stay, which made things much easier. However, the mattress was a bit too firm for my liking, which affected the comfort slightly. Also, just a heads-up for future guests: the entrance to the property is through a clothing store, which was a bit unexpected at first but manageable once you get used to it. Overall, a decent stay with great location value and a helpful host!"

Very clean and comfortable.<br/>Hanh was a great host- she communicated very well with us and was very attentive to our needs. <br/>The only downsides were that we didn't realise the stay is located within a clothing shop, and that we literally had to walk through a store to get to our place. I feel that could have been communicated better. Also, there were people being extremely loud within the apartment staircase and outside our door during the middle of both our nights which woke us- but hopefully that's a one off."

Although very hard, the bed was actually comfortable once lying down and we had a good nights sleep.<br/>The apartment was smaller than we thought (although not a problem) and there were several ants around the bed. We got rid of the ones we could see and luckily had no further problems. Hanh was a good host and responsive when we couldn’t access the main door when we arrived, providing us with another passcode."

The room was lovely, very quiet (difficult to get here!) in a new build complex. The security was outstanding, discreet and yet very attentive and watchful, always ready to smile and open the door - he even leant my friend and iPhone charger! The hosts are amazing, they work as a team and there is always someone available even reaching out to me at 3am after a late booking. Cheap Grab taxis can take you to the most popular parts of the city quite quickly; you'll likely need to use them, but darting around by Grab is the local culture and as you'll be doing that anyway it's better to stay somewhere a bit quiet I think."

Impressively clean and conveniently located, it offered a tranquil environment while still being close to the city's vibrant centre. The facilities, including a pool, gym, and sauna, were excellent, adding a touch of luxury to our stay. Highly recommend for a comfortable and enjoyable visit."

Just had a little miscommunication with the host and team, but the way had it all figured out and was very accommodating. Great added service was the ability to store luggage if you arrive early before check in time or depart late after checkout. It helps a lot. Would book again."

The room was well-equipped and had all the necessities I needed. There’s a few restaurants within walking distance and the pool is a highlight of the property. The host is responsive and they have someone to welcome you which is quite nice. I would highly recommend this for a stay in HCMC."

Tầng thượng ban đêm bật đèn trông rất đẹp và sạch sẽ. Chủ nhà rất khéo léo decor không gian trong nhà nên dù nhà có hơi hẹp những vẫn cảm giác rất tiện nghi và thoải mái. Tóm lại với số tiền bỏ ra thì đây là 1 nơi lưu trú quá tuyệt vời!!!"

Danke hierfür! Für jede Frage etc. gab es in kürze direkt eine Rückmeldung. Wichtig zu erwähnen wäre noch, dass sie dieses airbnb in einem Haus befindet, wo unten eine Schneiderei ist. Das war uns nicht ganz bewusst & war anfangs etwas unangenehm, aber das verging schnell. Das  Highlight war definitiv die Leinwand & die Waschmaschine inkl. Trockner DANKE! Zu bemängeln hätte ich nur, das dass Zimmer gründlicher gereinigt werden hätte können. Das ist allerdings „meckern“ auf hohem Niveau :-)"

Они были на связи, подсказали, куда лучше пойти на ТЕТ, скинули подробные инструкции по заселению. <br/>Район хороший. Кафешек много, есть кофе и круглосуточный магазин. <br/>Рекомендую это жилье!"

The apartment is even better than in the photos, with a lovely view of the city. The place was very clean and had a pleasant scent, and the bed was also very comfortable. I loved the Japanese-style toilet; it was a very enjoyable experience. Hannah was very responsive and proactive in communications, and she provided good recommendations based on my needs. I will definitely return and I recommend it 100%. Thank you, Hannah, for this haven of peace."

Phòng ốc được dọn dẹp sạch sẽ, mang lại cảm giác thoải mái và dễ chịu ngay từ lúc bước vào. Tiện nghi trong căn hộ cũng đầy đủ và tiện lợi, từ bếp, nhà tắm cho đến phòng ngủ, phòng giặt – tất cả đều hoạt động tốt và phục vụ tốt nhu cầu của tôi, đặc biệt còn có máy chiếu rất chill. Phòng còn đẹp đúng như hình ảnh quảng cáo, không có sự khác biệt, đặc biệt là view từ phòng thực sự xuất sắc, mang đến trải nghiệm tuyệt vào mọi thời điểm trong ngày. Hơn hết, chủ nhà rất nhiệt tình, luôn sẵn sàng hỗ trợ khi cần. Đây là một lựa chọn hoàn hảo cho chuyến đi chơi vừa rồi của tôi, và chắc chắn tôi sẽ quay lại nếu có dịp <3."

Host có trang bị RẤT NHIỀU nến thơm nhưng ko sử dụng được vì đã dùng cạn đáy, ko còn 1 cái nào có thể dùng được(kiểu là cho có thôi chứ dùng ko được)<br/>4. Phòng giặt đồ để đồ dùng rất lộn xộn nhìn rất thiếu thẩm mỹ<br/>5. Host nên trang bị giá treo để máy chiếu, phòng có 2 vực cod thể dùng máy nhưng phaie khá tốn thgina để tụi mình setup. Trong phòng ngủ thì ko setup được<br/>Nhìn chung vs căn này ngoài view thì ko có gì cả, mình đã trải nghiệm rất nhiều staycation nhưng trải nghiệm ở đây là thấy ko ưng nhất và chi phí khá cao dù bạn book ngày thường hay lễ thì chi phí này so với trải nghiệm là quá tệ, phòng ốc cũng ko được vệ sinh sạch sẽ, mạng nhện, bụi đóng đầy khe cửa kính, rèm cửa màu trắng mà nó ố vàng . Host nên chỉn chu hơn nếu thật sự thu phí với mức này. Bọn mình có hình ảnh."

The apartment was also very clean, which I appreciated.<br/>However, there was one significant issue that impacted my stay. The balcony door lacked curtains, which meant the living room was flooded with sunlight throughout the day. This made it difficult to use my laptop or enjoy the projector that was provided. If curtains were added to the balcony door, this would be a fantastic place to stay."

Ban đầu nhìn hình ảnh thì cảm thấy ko tin tưởng lắm, sợ là ảnh bị chỉnh quá nhiều nên mới đẹp được vậy nhưng sau khi nói chuyện với Dani (chủ căn hộ) thì mình tin tưởng hơn nên thử book 1 ngày. Ko ngờ rằng khi nhận thì nó giống ảnh hoàn toàn luôn ạ. Mình rất thích những căn chill cũng như có gu thẩm mỹ do tìm những căn như vậy rất khó và ở đây đã đáp ứng được điều đó. Cảm ơn Dani đã hỗ trợ mình nhiệt tình nhé."

Đối với một người thường xuyên di chuyển khắp nơi và ưa thích áo quần thơm tho, sạch sẽ như mình thì việc sử dụng máy giặt thoải mái là một điểm cộng. Địa chỉ định vị trên bản đồ chỉ mang tính tương đối, khi cần bắt taxi hay grab nên đi ra quán Ốc Đào gần đó sẽ dễ dàng cho tài xế hơn."

The mezzanine was private away from other people & there was air-con and a fan to keep us cool. Luisa was lovely & helped even with any stupid questions we had! would definitely recommend, especially for people on a lower budget that want something cosy in a neighbourhood that’s got some nightlife and authenticity. It was a 15 min grab from the city aswell so about £1.70. Would definitely recommend"

          "comments": "We absolutely loved our stay at Case Co Core! The location was perfect—tucked away from the busy backpacker streets in a more authentic, local part of Saigon, which gave us a real sense of the city’s everyday life. Luisa was a fantastic host—warm, responsive, and full of great recommendations. We followed most of her tips, from delicious street food to cozy coffee spots, atmospheric bars, and vibrant markets, and every single one was a gem.<br/>Her home is a beautiful reflection of her artistic and creative spirit—full of greenery, inspiring details, and thoughtful touches that made us feel completely at home. It was the perfect base for our Saigon adventures. Highly recommended!<br/>Lots of love from Kathleen and Nimrod"

I’m Vietnamese, but I’m leaving this review in English so that international travelers can read it. The room was clean, tidy, and thoughtfully prepared by the host. The host was friendly, responded immediately whenever needed, and always checked in to make sure I was comfortable. The location is incredibly convenient—perfect for those without personal transportation, as everything you might need is available nearby"

I felt right at home and the host communicated super efficiently proved to be extremely helpful when needed. I would definitely recommend booking with this host at this location. I felt very secure with the gate that leads to the Airbnb, and there was plenty around me to walk to whether it was food, a spa, coffee or ATM. 10/10 would book again. Thank you for such a wonderful stay 💕"

They were always very helpful.<br/>Really good little coffee shop just outside the alley (Lac).<br/>It’s worth noting the location is out of the busy area of HCM, about 20-30 mins walk or a very cheap grab bike away. We appreciated being in a quieter area, but it’s just outside of the pick up area for most tours so bear in mind you may have to walk 10 mins for pick up.<br/>Overall a great stay 😊"

Điểm cộng lớn là có máy chiếu rõ nét và máy lạnh rất mát. Bạn chủ thân thiện, nhiệt tình và luôn trả lời ngay lập tức, cảm ơn bạn nhé ❤️"

Tủ lạnh được cắm sẵn trong phòng giúp tôi bảo quản được đồ uống, có sẵn đá. Home rất chu đáo chuẩn bị lược, tăm bông trên bàn. Sạch sẽ check in dễ dàng, home hơi khó tìm, mình nghĩ home nên để bảng có đèn để dễ tìm hơn vì mình check in buổi tối. Chị chủ rep nhanh và tôn trọng khách."

Fits right on my preferences such as close to local neighborhood where you can eat local food, walkable to affordable local restaurant, convenient store, public market and public bus going to D1 and terminal bus if your going to Danang and Hue.

          "comments": "The place is quite small and best suited for a solo traveler like me. Although it’s located in District 1, it feels a bit far from the main areas. However, bus stops are nearby, requiring a 6–10 minute walk. The accommodation provides basic amenities, and the host is very responsive, which is a big plus. One issue I noticed was the presence of small insects in the restroom and mosquitoes in the bed area, which can be bothersome if you’re sensitive to bugs. Also, there are no windows, which might make the space feel a bit suffocating, especially if you’re staying for more than a few days. However, you can go up to the rooftop to get some fresh air and enjoy a view of the neighborhood, which is a nice breather and a good place to relax for a while. Despite these minor concerns, the stay was decent overall. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option for a short trip, this place is okay for a quick stay. It’s not perfect, but for the price, it’s a reasonable choice."

The room was at the top of the building and it was boiling inside. The AC ran on 18oC, all the fans were on but we couldn’t breathe. It only got better after the sun set. The bathroom was literally a sauna. The hotel staff was super helpful but the room itself needs lots of upgrading to block the heat. Anyways, I would come back but definitely not roof top."

Great location for either a business trip, solo traveller or couple, and the Notre Dame Cathedral could be visible from the window as a bonus. Highly recommended for a short or medium length trip to Ho Chi Minh city."

And i almost forgot about the bathtub, believe it or not, having a bath after a long day adventuring and exploring is just a hit. Finally, the location is quite convenient (near center) and has a lot of places that can be reached on foots. <br/>Highly recommended, definitely coming back once i have a chance to visit HCMC again."

Das Apartment ist leicht zu finden, die Aussicht wunderschön und die Klimaanlage funktioniert gut – wichtig, da Dachgeschoss. Leider wirkt das Apartment auf den Fotos größer als in echt. Es war relativ laut, und die Toilette hat unangenehm gerochen – das ließ sich aber gut lösen, wenn man die Tür schloss und das Fenster im Bad öffnete. Beim Duschen lief Wasser unter der Badewanne aus, was den Aufenthalt etwas beeinträchtigt hat. Außerdem waren einige Ameisen im Raum. Die Vorhänge mussten meist geschlossen bleiben, da es sonst sehr schnell aufheizte, wodurch man die schöne Aussicht nur eingeschränkt genießen konnte. Trotzdem: Die Rezeption war jederzeit freundlich und hilfsbereit, auch kleine Dinge wie Getränke waren unkompliziert erhältlich. Für den Preis war die Unterkunft in Ordnung – wenn das Badezimmerproblem behoben wird, wäre es wirklich rundum gut."

Everything was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated, with lovely plants that added a refreshing touch.<br/>Being on the top floor, the apartment offered stunning views and a serene atmosphere that perfectly captured the Saigon vibe. The bathtub and hot water were a delight, making it easy to relax after a day of exploring. The AC worked perfectly, and the kitchenette was great for making morning coffee. <br/>Overall, a fantastic place to stay! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a comfortable and charming base in Saigon."

Ha even went the extra mile and answered my question late at night when I needed some help, and that I really appreciate. <br/>The home is tucked in a small alley above a cafe, but despite that it was generally very quiet and private which was honestly better than I expected. There are some nice restaurants nearby and street food is just a minute walk away. <br/>The key point for me was the location. It's really close to the airport so it helps alleviate some of my anxiety with flight check-in scheduling.<br/>Overall the amenities were in good condition, the light switches did get a bit confusing for me but nothing that couldn't be solved by asking Ha. Overall would stay again!"

The apartment has a great location, very close to the airport, making it perfect for a long layover. It's located in a small alley, so it's quiet. And there are some interesting restaurants and coffee places nearby. <br/>One tricky thing is the stairs to the second floor; they're a bit steep and can get slippery after rain, so heads up. If you have luggage, the staff from the cafe on the first floor can help you get it to the second floor. Also, the check-in and check-out are easy and smooth since the keys are available for pick up at the cafe on the first floor. <br/>Overall, it's a great pick for the money for a few days before the flight. And thank you, Ha, for being a very responsive and helpful host. Best of luck to you!"

Hot water that is actually hot when needed. The only thing is the road was having construction that bikes and cars had a hard time going through (August, 2025), but I’m sure that’s temporary. Staffs are super nice, thank you for carrying my luggages up and down the stairs!!! Definitely will book again in the future."

The light and socket next to the bed was super convenient.<br/>The design of the place is also very cool. Despite the location being busy and noisy downstairs, the buzz and noise does not reach the Airbnb at all, so we did not have any trouble resting or sleeping. We didn't even get to use the earplugs we bought specifically for this place 😆<br/>Overall, this is a great place to stay in Sai Gon. Would love to stay again on our next visit!"

It’s located in the iconic Cafe Apartment building, which makes it super easy to find and adds a unique charm to the experience.<br/>Virgo was a fantastic host — extremely responsive and proactive in answering all our questions, not just about the apartment but also with great tips on sightseeing and things to do around the city.<br/>The location is unbeatable. Right on the prime walking street, you’re just a 10-minute walk away from everything you could need — cafes, shops, landmarks, and more.<br/>Highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the area. Would definitely come back!"

I would add a hot plate for cooking, but other than that no complaint. The host was very responsive. They answered me right away everytime I had a question. I highly recommend this place. I will be back in a few weeks and hopefully will be able to rent again!"

Bathroom is very small with a shower next to the toilet. Lounge. There were toiletries available. Balcony views are of a cramped alleyway. The only windows/natural light are from the front door.<br/>The small elevator up costs 3000 Dong to use however I elected to walk up the 2 flights of stairs for the exercise."

Only thing to note - the main gate to the building closes at 11 or midnight. There's a security guy that stays there so you need to wake up him to get in/get out when later than those times. Not a big deal but something to be aware of. Would stay again for the central location."

I open up this to host, and he basically said “bottled water is super popular in Ho chi minh. I don’t think this is the right attitude especially while people coming here to get rest and have good time. There were ants all over the place. And there is a distinct noticeable smell which disturbed me. I came very late and had to leave early in the morning. I was too tired to change the room and go another place or make complaints to airbnb. Room is super super small, i couldn’t even able to do morning body stretch(which you don’t need much space). And the ground was not clean. Towels were terrible, i don’t know what kind of material was it but it was unable to dry the water dipping from my body. Worst airbnb experience ever."

Aunty and uncle are very lovely, friendly, and always there to help. The room is inside the host house but very private. The neighborhood itself is not as chaotic as another part of the city in my pov. Kudos for the host for having full amenities available."

From the moment we arrived, they were welcoming, friendly, and quick to respond to any questions. Their helpfulness made our trip smoother and more enjoyable.<br/>The property was exactly as pictured—stylish, spotless, and very comfortable. It’s clear a lot of care went into making it feel like a home away from home. We especially appreciated how well-equipped the space was—we had everything we needed.<br/>The location was another highlight! Being close to District 1 made exploring the city super convenient. Free laundry and weekly cleaning during our stay were thoughtful bonuses that really stood out.<br/>This was one of our best Airbnb experiences. The combination of a great space and genuinely kind hosts made our time truly special. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and welcoming stay."

Additionally, his family is always in the residence, so can always reach out to them if there's anything needed."

I contact Bean and he said I have to walk 10m to get to the house. I canceled the Airbnb and was charged $126 dollars for service fee even though I didn’t stay there . I contact bean and told him I had canceled the place bc 10 minute walk to the house is too far and I don’t feel safe. We later talked realize we had misunderstanding. He meant 10 m=32 ft 9.701 in or 10 steps… not 10 mins - he was able to refund my full booking and I appreciate it. If I knew it was only 10 steps I would had stayed. Also think my taxi guy lied so he can drive around longer for fare fee"

I came on a Saturday night and it was quite lively but that is to be expected anywhere really. It was very quiet for the rest of the week. Host is very professional and is looking to assist you. Room has a window that opens to a wall which allows ventilation. And another one that opens to the commons area. Great place especially for the price and location."

Benthan, Independence Sq, Skydeck, museum etc are walkable, Bui Vien St. was just the backdoor alley. The also have cute cafes and eateries around hosting people with all sorts of budget. The stay is exactly identical to the photos, the tariffs are reasonable for the location, and the hosts treat people well. I would be happy to visit again."

The location is right by the party street so that is convenient if you’re looking for that. I loved that 7/11, family mart and grocery store and bus stations were all steps away. The room had the bare essentials. Only one outlet with two plugs worked by the bed. The desk was small. The bed and bedding wasn’t very comfortable hence me staying elsewhere. Also the towels provided were dirty, one was the color of cream/grey and other had dark spots. Also the drain in the shower did not drain but the water pressure and heat were good. They did have extra towels and other things like toilet paper downstairs so that helped. I struggled with the outside lock and my room lock multiple times each time I entered. If I stayed for only a few nights like two, I would be fine. But if I were to stay longer, I’d look for other accommodations."

The location is ideal—quiet, yet only a 2-minute walk from Bui Vien walking street, with lots of nearby restaurants. The room is clean and comes with basic toiletries, free noodles, water, and bikes to use. The 3rd-floor room requires stairs, but it wasn’t an issue for me. It’s a great value for a comfortable and safe stay. Phuong, the host, is friendly and responsive. Highly recommended!"

The location is just near Bhen Than and all the major malls like Saigon center and some tourist attractions. It's an old building, but it's very clean. They will also help you with your bags.<br/>The unit is beautiful. A perfect place to just chill down , sleep, and do your laundry, especially after travelling for so long. Everything you need is in the unit. We initially booked for 3 nights, and we decided to extend for another 3 nights.<br/>Anne and Taylor hosted us a couple of times from their other properties, and as always, they are very accommodating and among the best hosts. <br/>We will stay again. Thank you, Anne and Taylor! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!"

The staff was nice too, I had struggles to lock the door on my way out, but when I messaged them to help me they replied in seconds so I hadn’t had to wait.<br/>The location was great, there was a Circle K, GS25 and Ministop where I could go whenever I needed it and several cafés nearby. Also I felt quite safe because right next to me was the police station of District 4. <br/>I really liked to stay there, it’s recommended and I hope to get to stay there again ^^"

But they cannot capture one thing: the feeling.<br/>People said the feeling is the complex combination of many things, and for this one: the ambient light in the room shielding me from the cold hard rain outside; the decent scent welcoming me upon opening the door; the clean air with every breath. Together, they construct something simple yet profound: warmth.<br/>The warmth on a busy street, in the heart of Saigon, on a raining day.<br/>I find myself already eager for a return, soon."

It was also very well-located, in district 1 surrounded with lots of great food choices (it was only 2-3 mins walk from this delicious banh mi place called banh mi thanks, as well as lots of other food choices like pho, and even really nice bars. It's also just a few mins walk to the main shopping street in district 1 (i went crazy shopping here) and just a 2-3 min bike ride to the party streets (so you won't be bothered by the noise at night). <br/>I will definitely be booking this place again when i come back to ho chi minh !! great value for money, super comfy/cosy/clean/spacious and amazing location. LOVE IT !!! Thank you Ngoc for a great stay :)"

In addition, the essentials I needed during my stay were within reach (e.g. fast food/restaurant or food stalls, mini-mart, bank, market, transportation, etc. Most importantly, I'd commend John because he's a great host; he's helpful and responsive."

The bed is too big giving small space to move. The stairs were extremely narrow, which made it difficult for me as a solo female traveler to carry all my heavy bags up to the 5th floor. In fact, my luggage got damaged because of it.<br/>One unusual thing was that the toilet and bedroom were separate rooms. The toilet was connected to the kitchen, which was a shared space. This meant that when taking a shower, I couldn't just walk back to my room in a towel, as someone might be in the kitchen. It was a bit inconvenient and made me feel uncomfortable.<br/>In terms of maintenance, the place could definitely use some fresh paint, and the kitchen and fridge were in need of a good cleaning.<br/>Despite these issues, the location was great and the price was very affordable. I'm hopeful that the host will address these concerns to ensure the comfort of future guest."

          "comments": "For all Moslem Indonesian tourist, i really rekomen this place untuk kalian yang mau berwisata di Saigon. Dekat penginapan ada makanan halal untuk pagi & siang dan masjid (jarak 300 meter). Ke ben thanh market jaraknya cuma 1 kilo yg bisa ditempuh dengan berjalan kaki. Lingkungannya adem, transport online banyak. Deket minimarket dan ada dapurnya. Jadi utk kalian yg mau stay halal untuk makanan bisa masak sendiri disini. (Biar lebih menjaga halal bisa bawa alat makan & pan mini utk masak). Host nya enak diajak komunikasi dan sangat solutif. Aku diberi izin nyuci baju juga. Jgn lupa habisin malam hari di bui vien street. Ke opera house pun menurutku ga jauh ya, mah bisa ditempuh jalan kaki, gak berasa krn sambil ngobrol. Tp balik lagi ke preferensi kalian yaaa."

Có sự sai sót về mô tả tiện nghi gia vị bếp, mình đã nhắn tin nhưng không nhận được thời gian phản hồi là bao lâu, sau khi đợi không có phản hồi mình phải chủ động gọi cho sđt liên hệ booking. Tuy là có giải quyết nhanh cho mình nhưng trải nghiệm lần đầu nên khá thất vọng. TV là truyền hình cáp, tuy nhiên remote không mở được, các bạn hỗ trợ thay pin, thay remote mở lên thì TV bị lỗi. <br/>Tóm lại, trải nghiệm lần đầu ở đây hơi thất vọng, nhưng cũng không phải quá tệ."

The apartment is as described and clean and has an amazing wifi connection and good work table etc. But the place has a tired look all over and some mould in the bathroom ceiling. The location is great, close to a lot of eateries and bars. The neighbourhood comes alive in the evenings. Overall a good stay!"

Nhiệt tình hỗ trợ và hướng dẫn. <br/>- Homestay sạch sẽ tiện nghi, decor rất là đẹp. Homestay nằm trong hẻm yên tĩnh và cũng gần các cửa hàng tiện lợi.<br/>- Phòng ốc sạch sẽ, thơm tho, đầy đủ đồ dùng và thoáng đãng. Phòng tắm riêng sạch sẽ và rộng rãi, có nước nóng để sử dụng.<br/>- Khu vực bếp chung có cả máy giặt và sấy, dụng cụ ăn uống đầy đủ, có cả tủ lạnh chung và khu vực ăn uống trong nhà cũng như ngoài trời.<br/>- Gửi xe trong nhà đảm bảo an toàn và rộng rãi. <br/>- Điểm cần cải thiện duy nhất là máy chiếu hơi mờ và mạng đôi khi hơi yếu.<br/>Tổng quan là 4.7/5, chắc chắn sẽ ghé lại ❤️"

When we arrived, the place is very clean and smells really nice. The common space is also very clean and complete with everything.  <br/>If I come back to HCMC, I'd definitely choose Hai's place again ☺️😍"

I feel like home when I first walked into the house. Spacious living room and kitchen with full equipment for a business or leisure trip, or even a family trip. The host is very responsive, and helpful. Highly recommend."

Room was filled with ants or termite here and there. Over all the experience was good. Rooms are on 1 and 2 nd floor there is no lift if you have heavy luggage kingly request for 1st floor preferably. Host attitude was great though checkout was really strict though she allowed us long enough in waiting area. 🙂 it was a happy experience excluding Ants / Termite issue ( I had few red bumps on my legs in morning )"

Khoa's family were welcoming throughout my stay but never intruded in any way. Any questions I had were quickly answered. A nice alternative if you dont want to stay in district 1. It's a 15-20 minute to district 1 if you do want to be relatively near the d1 nightlife."

The space was cozy and well-equipped with everything I needed — a comfortable bed, strong Wi-Fi, and a modern bathroom.<br/>The location was ideal — just a short ride to District 1, but tucked away enough to enjoy a quieter, more local vibe. There were lots of local eateries, convenience stores, and coffee shops nearby, which made exploring the neighborhood really fun and convenient.<br/>The host was super friendly and responsive. They provided clear instructions for check-in and were available to answer any questions throughout my stay. I especially appreciated the small touches like bottled water, toiletries.<br/>Overall, I highly recommend this place if you’re visiting HCMC and want a mix of comfort, local charm, and easy access to the city’s hotspots."

The host was very communicative and friendly which I really appreciated. When I told them about the ants I found in bed with me the first morning, they sent someone to clean the floor and change the bedding. The ants just happened to be very stubborn and they returned right away. Finding 2 roaches on the kitchen counter the night before I left was essentially the thing that made me realize I just couldn't do it anymore. I'm very grateful that the guy who did the cleaning left some bug spray behind when I asked him to"

It was manageable.<br/>Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely return!"

          "comments": "Very cozy place with great location, look just like in the photo, unfortunately upon on our arrival the toilet really smelled badly and it wasn’t flushed so it had really strong urine smell, could solve that with one flush from me. I know, but the smelled was still there, just less stronger, even after 4 nights of my stay. I also need to mention that bathroom has strong chlorine smell too. But other than that It was nice place to stay, close by to good Phở place, also near Circle K, and very easy and cheap to get to walking center, it only cost 15k Đông (0.50 USD) with Grab Bike to get to city center. Anyway I have to give kudos to owner’s projector and wifi speed. Projector was very good quality, great for movie night or just for listening to music. The wifi speed I had was around 150mb/s, thanks to that I could work remotely. So if you don’t mind the smell of chlorine, then I would really recommend it. Anyway, the smell of chlorine also tells us that bathroom is disinfected and clean"

Удобный стол для работы для двух человек, wi-fi отлично работает.<br/>Расположение не на шумной улице, но при этом всё рядом: кафе, супермаркет, рынок, парк. Пешком можно дойти до большинства достопримечательностей и торговых центров. <br/>Заселение по сути бесконтактное, инструкции хозяин предоставил очень понятные. <br/>За окном решетки, электронный замок на входе в здание и в комнату, - всё это дает ощущение безопасности. <br/>Благодарим за гостеприимство и рекомендуем это место!"

The balcony is photogenic. Amenities are well equipped. <br/>The only disadvantage I could think of is the quite steep stair and climbing 3-floor of thin steel (inside) may cause discomfort for those afraid of height."

Hatten wir Fragen, wurde uns schnell geantwortet und auf unsere Bedürfnisse eingegangen (Check-Out um 12 Uhr).<br/>Der Balkon könnte Stühle haben, dann würde man draußen noch schöner sitzen. Wir haben uns die schweren Stühle rausgestellt und nach Benutzung immer wieder reingetragen (bzgl. der Regengefahr).<br/>Die Bettwäsche ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig. Sie war aus Seide oder etwas ähnlich rutschigem. <br/>Einfache Baumwollbettwäsche wäre sehr viel angenehmer (auch bei den Temperaturen). Durch die Klimaanlage und den Ventilator konnte die Wohnung schnell gekühlt werden und Abends hatten wir sogar die Balkontür auf und es kam schöne frische Luft hinein.<br/>Immer wieder gerne :)"

Its surreal.<br/>Love the balcony tranquil vibes, little bench with quilt and sound of birds tweeting in the morning. We did like the projector for watching netflix. The host is also extremely helpful and responsive, such a pleasure to talk to. <br/>Some minor things to note is that its quite a climb to the 3rd floor for guest who struggle with climbing stairs. Also, there may be other guests living on the bottom floor can be quite loud if they are travelling in a big group. But all in all, the stay was still definitely worth every bit, delightful, convenient and we dont regret it one bit. Will come again!"

We stayed on the top floor and loved the privacy and calm atmosphere. The room looked exactly like the photos, maybe even better, with high-quality amenities and a cozy, welcoming feel.<br/>The location is perfect: tucked in a quiet alley but just a short walk to Bui Vien and many of Saigon’s main attractions. It’s peaceful but super convenient.<br/>Yen was an amazing host, very responsive, kind, and helpful throughout our stay. You can really feel the care put into every detail. We’d absolutely stay again and highly recommend La Sol to anyone visiting HCMC"

I was able to wash and dry my clothes easily, especially since it’s currently rainy season. Even though there’s a balcony, it’s not really practical for drying clothes when it rains, so having a dryer was a lifesaver 👍<br/>Thanks so much for the comfortable stay 😊 🙏"

The host was exceptionally attentive, always checking in to ensure I had everything I needed and even offering room cleaning whenever necessary.<br/>The location was absolutely perfect—right in the heart of Binh Thanh, with easy access to key areas in Saigon. Whether it was exploring the city, finding great food spots, or just enjoying the local atmosphere, everything was within reach.<br/>What truly set this stay apart was the host’s kindness and thoughtfulness. Their commitment to making my experience smooth and enjoyable was unmatched. It’s rare to find such genuine hospitality, and I’m incredibly grateful for it.<br/>Without a doubt, I will be staying here again when I return to Saigon and I wholeheartedly encourage others to book this Airbnb."

I also love the smell of the room itself. Even if it’s shared, the room still smells divine! Same with the bathroom. It was very clean even if it was shared. The internet is reliable as well. :) If you need to work, the internet surely would not let you down. All in all, I like my stay in Mochi’s place. I didn’t have any issues at all. :) If I comeback to Saigon on a budget, I would definitely stay here again. (It’s literally near everything! ☺️) This accommodation is definitely worth it."

          "comments": "Very peculiar hostel style focused on being clean and quiet to have a good reste rather than social hostel. Please be mindful that there is no reception or common areas to sit down and socialize.<br/>I really like this context of hotel for a day or two when you need to focus on your well being and to rest and recharge your social batteries. The dormitory rooms are spacious with a couch, a private toilet with shower and small kitchen. The only thing I notice was missing was the chairs and the table as in the pictures. I just assume those were removed to provide the room with more \"manoeuvrability\" <br/>The beds are very comfortable, there is a charger and a light and the bunk bed has a curtain for privacy, a shelf to place your belongings and even a small closed locker private to you and within the sleeping area, already with a key so you do not need a locker.<br/>Also all the doors do not make any noise when they close! The place is very clean,  easy checkinand a few guests appear to be locals"

PROS: I really liked the location, you're tucked in a back alley, but the surrounding streets will surprise you, there's so many great coffee shops and restaurants (Awesome vegetarian options too – also check out Phaya Thai Spa for excellent massage). The room is clean, with good aircon & wifi, and looks better than the photos. The host is super responsive and friendly. All up, good value for money. CONS: The room is a little dark, the bathroom has a slight smell. There were a few small issues (ants in the bedroom, someone smoking inside, trying to access the main door) but to be fair, the host was very quick to find a solution."

          "comments": "Michel is one of the best hosts I've met, going out of his way to meet my needs, and super responsive. The location is about 30-40 mins walk (1.5-2km) to city center (Nnuyan Hui promenade, Vincom mall, Train station, etc.) and it's close to Tan Dinh market and the pink church. The neighborhood is very local, for an authentic experience, but if you are looking for sth new, modern and international, you should considerD2/3 instead. There are tons of cafes, restos, supermarkets, massage parlors nearby. 20 mins to airport by car. The building has a locked gate downstairs so it feels safe, and it's quiet at night. For a 5-star review, I'd give Michel 10, my only complaint is the place is bit old and lack of maintenance, amenities look old and worn (such as the drain, sinks, aircon, etc.) and there's a certain stale smell which didn't change after they used air refresher. Overall it's good value for money for solo travelers/couples."

It's pretty much the perfect distance from the busy city centre.  <br/>There's a gym just across the river called Rạch Miễu Gym Center which does cheap day passes if you need a place to workout during your stay, and there's also Le Van Tam Park if you want to go for a morning/evening run (you can also jog along the river).<br/>Recommended for both tourist and longer stays."

It's one of the best we have stayed in HCM, not just squeaky clean and spacious, but also in a pretty vicinity with great local vibes. So many cafés and restaurants within walking distance, a good and big gym nearby, and it's possible to take a straight bus to Ben Thanh. The host Michel is super responsive and proactive, he really worked hard to make us feel comfortable here. I will recommend him and this place over and over! Merci beaucoup de nous recevoir, a bientot!"

We arrived at midnight but getting here was easy since it’s just a bridge away from District 1. The residential complex felt homey, safe, and peaceful, with plenty of great food options nearby, plus a convenience store and ATM just around the corner. The space itself is beautiful — exactly as shown in the photos and very clean and well-maintained. The only minor challenge we had was that it’s on the 3rd floor with no elevator, so we had to carry our luggage up, but we didn’t really mind. Mekong Lounge gave us a cozy, comfortable home base throughout our trip. The host, Le Thi My, is warm, kind, and very responsive — she helped us with all our questions, gave great local recommendations, and made us feel welcome. We truly appreciated her hospitality and would happily stay here again and recommend her place to friends visiting Saigon!"

Bathroom was clean and had a separate shower (not a wet one which was important to us)!! Water pressure is a little weak but nothing we couldn’t work with. Check in instructions included a video that made it super easy. Security was great as we were in a little communal area off the main road and the gates closed as night. Location was close to District 1 and so it was easy to get around via grab (5 minute ride or 15 minute walk but it’s really hot). Also super close to Com Tam Calamette which was our favourite meal during our time there!!! Overall we’d recommend :)"

It was also really good in terms of sound- compared to many places around the city, it was very peaceful. <br/>It was so awesome having a full set up for movies & games. <br/>We did run in to the problem of having ants all over the kitchen & bathroom but the owner was so prompt & came over to clean & spray the areas within the same morning! <br/>Also, the shower pressure wasn’t good but I can’t really fault it for that. <br/>We had an amazing stay, if we’re back in the city we would absolutely stay again! <br/>Thanks so much!"

If you’re ever in Saigon this is the place to stay :)"

          "comments": "Staying at these apartments was an absolute pleasure! The space is roomy, cozy, and perfectly located just a short walk from the center of Saigon. The price is more than fair for what you get.<br/>The real gem here is the gaming setup — not only can you play on the TV, but there's also a full arcade machine packed with classic retro games! It's a super fun and nostalgic experience, and the controls are intuitive. We'd love to see a small booklet with tips and descriptions of the top games — that would make it even more awesome ^__^<br/>Everything else was great too: very clean, high-quality shampoo and shower gel in the bathroom, well-functioning air conditioner, and a large desk that's perfect for remote work. The only minor downside is carrying your luggage up to the third floor, as there's no elevator — not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of.<br/>Highly recommend this place to any gamer or anyone who appreciates a fun and comfortable place to stay!"

Fun and well designed apartment, cozy and comfortable in D4 that's a bit away from the where all tourists roam, but its a 20-30 minute walk to anywhere or a 5-10 minute grab bike ride. As I  got to know the area more, I liked it more and more, walk around the narrow streets and immerse yourself in the real Vietnam"

This is a genuine, local  and residential setting, you’ll feel like a local.  The decor was so fun and unique, some really cool stuff.  Everything we needed was to hand, umbrellas, sun hats, needle & thread etc…<br/>Loved sitting on the balcony, filled with plants & bonsai, over-looking the communal area below. <br/>Loved the arcade game & big screen TV & super comfy sofa.  This place made our stay in Saigon unforgettable."

Only downside is no elevator so if you have big luggage it might be a bit inconvenient. There’s one coffee shop right on the 1st floor, probably owned by the Airbnb owner as well, they serve pretty good drinks and open 7am-11pm so its pretty nice. <br/>Nếu Airbnb thêm khăn tắm/bàn là thì sẽ OK hơn. Phòng đẹp chill như ảnh, nếu có hành lý nặng thì hơi bất tiện vì ko có thang máy. Quanh quanh Airbnb cũng nhiều quán ăn khuya."

As an artist and interior designee I truly appreciate his high standards which are evident in his tasteful selections used in the textiles, furniture chiloices and layers of lighting used to create a space that is both comfortable and homie.<br/>All in all, the apartment provides an understated esthetic appeal that delights.<br/>Everything is in good working order and Virgo is a most reliable host.<br/>Next time, I hope to  return for a much longer visit and to stay again in one of Virgo's well curated appointments  💯% thanks 🌻"

Just note that it can be a bit noisy at night, so those sensitive to noise might want to keep that in mind. The street is one-way, and you’ll need to cross it to catch a cab, which can be tricky during rush hour. Also, there’s no elevator, so be prepared if you have heavy luggage."

The traffic noise is a little jarring as the windows are not sound proof, but Hana mitigated that with ear plugs which softened the harsh sounds. Water heater is a little erratic, occasionally having hot water but more days we only had cold water. Use the kettle for warm baths. The service is really the best thing about the place honestly, as Hana and the building manager were very responsive to our every need. Otherwise, location is in the middle of a street that’s way too busy all the time. If you’re not on a budget, booking a hotel nearer to Takashimaya would be nicer. However for budget travellers, this airbnb does just fine,"

Host was super friendly, met us personally and helped with everything.<br/>Main drawback: NOISE! Apartment faces an extremely busy road with non-stop traffic. The older AC unit adds more noise at night. We actually left after two nights because sleep was impossible.<br/>If you're not noise-sensitive, this place offers excellent value. For light sleepers like us, bring serious earplugs or consider elsewhere. The host did mention she will try to address it, so maybe contact her to find out more."

The internet works very well and the bed and pillows are comfortable. The place was also very clean. It is also very useful having a washing machine and small area to cook basic things. The building is also very safe and secure compared to many places to HCM having a modern lock code to enter the main gate. It would be useful to have a sponge for the kitchen though. Nonetheless, it is a nice place to stay that I can recommend."

It's also quite dark in the room at night which is a plus. It also wasn't super loud here. I had some minor issues with the toilet not flushing and some issues with the gate (the gate keycode is very difficult to figure out), and the electrical outlets are in inconvenient places. Because of the three matters above I would rate my stay a 3.5 or a 4. The location in d5 was fine, quite close to d1. If I needed to stay in d5 for a short time I wouldn't be shy about staying again seeing as the price is quite reasonable."

The location is perfect — right in the heart of District 1, super convenient for exploring the city, but still surprisingly peaceful. The room has a clean, modern style that made it feel like a little retreat from the busy streets outside. Everything was well-maintained and thoughtfully set up. A great mix of comfort and convenience — I’d happily stay again!"

I would recommend this area for everyone just because of how convenient it was with grab bike to get everywhere. No where ever took over 15 mins and to get to when going from there. Also the AC in the room works over time you’ll. I may have been roasting in the Saigon heat but sleeping at night felt like winter back in the states definitely gets chilly in there when sleeping🤣🤣"

The bathroom was not clean and is missing tiles in the shower so we were sandals for safety and sanitary reasons.

On devait y rester 4 jours, après une nuit dedans on a finalement opté pour un logement en face dans un hotel de meilleur standing... On a très mal dormi malgré le grand lit, donc on a pris nos affaires et on est parti voir ailleurs... En 3 semaines au Vietnam c'est le seul logement qui a été dans cet état là ! On est vraiment très déçu... Pour le prix en plus on s'attendait à un meilleur standing. Bref ! Passez votre chemin !"

The house is ideally situated in the city center, within walking distance of the walking street, coffee shops, restaurants, and convenience stores. Public transportation and ride-hailing services are also easily accessible from this location. I had a fantastic experience and would gladly return for my next trip. Highly recommended for travelers seeking comfort and convenience on a budget."

Hair dryer was strong and the fridge stayed very cold unlike most places in Vietnam. Grateful for the iron which is also rare. Very convenient that there’s a cafe on the ground floor. Being in the 3rd floor gives great exercise everytime you go up haha. Safe hidden gem. Walkable to restaurants and cafe yet a little on the outskirts of downtown district 1. Would recommend!"

The garden offers a relaxing retreat and has a security camera, which I was aware of, and it provides added reassurance, especially for solo travelers. Austin and Vanessa were responsive, friendly, and accommodating throughout my stay. Overall, a great experience blending style, comfort, and thoughtful details."

It’s tucked into a quiet corner with good lighting, a comfortable chair, and strong Wi-Fi. <br/>What really made the stay special was the host. Super friendly, responsive, and genuinely helpful from check-in to check-out. You can tell they care about making guests feel at home. If you're working remotely or just want a peaceful place to stay, this listing is a great choice!"

However, 2 things, the home can be quite hot in the day as it is on the highest floor but there are aircons, also there is a hidden camera at the corner of your private balcony that is not mentioned anywhere prior in the listing description or any communications, so that has impacted the quality of my stay as it was somewhat an invasion of privacy as the balcony was said to be private and accessible only to us (and it's proximity to the semi glass wall shower), which made us quite uncomfortable."

The stay was located in a good location, a few minutes away from key attractions like Independence Palace and Ben Thanh Market. There are many local food options and nice cafes in the area too!"

What mattered most to me were the little things that ensure guests are cared for; bathroom is well stocked, indoor slippers, well functioning hair dryer, clear instructions and communication. Ideal place for a simple and fuss free trip."

Aircon is located at the top, in front of your face, so it can be an issue if you have allergic rhinitis like me. Toilet is small but it's okay. Lock sensitivity is quite a hassle. We stayed at Room 102, you need to go up. Was supposed to stay at the third floor, since it's bigger and host initially said it was available but not anymore a day before we check in. Hosts are responsive. Location can be pinned on Grab, so that's cheaper than availing the airport pickup service. Overall, we recommend the place, just manage expectations and be flexible. :)"

The place was also conveniently located yet not filled with tourists. The fridge is not that cold so don't expect to put anything inside. The water pressure was also not very strong but good enough. Overall a good stay, complains were handled swiftly and I felt very welcomed by the team."

When I had to go to hospital due to being very sick, I was unable to pack my belongings and check out in time and Hannah went above and beyond to help me, sending a sped up video of her packing all my things up for me while I was sick in the hospital on fluids. I felt so comfortable and cared for in that moment and there was no expectation of money, though I made sure to show my appreciation with a tip and when I had been resting and unable to go out, she helped me set up the projector and made sure I could use the netflix. The place was great and in future I’ll be back and staying in one of the bigger places when i’m back with my partner. The team were so responsive and the extra attention to detail when I was sick was such a relief for me. 10/5 stars for me. Looking forward to seeing Hannah when she comes to Australia! 💖"

They were so friendly, warm, and incredibly supportive throughout my stay. You can tell they genuinely care about their guests’ comfort and happiness. From thoughtful touches in the room to helpful recommendations and warm conversations, they made me feel like more than just a visitor – we felt truly welcomed.<br/>Whether you’re staying for a short break or a longer escape, this place is a little sanctuary. It’s the kind of stay that leaves you feeling refreshed and grateful. We can’t recommend it enough, thank-you so so much again 😊✨🙌🏼"

Really quiet but well within walking distance of loads of great places to eat, coffee shops & local boutiques. Walking distance into the main areas too. The room was small but it was still perfect for me and my partner. We had such a lovely time here and will 100% stay next time we’re in Ho Chi Minh. The host was lovely when greeting us and was such a nice person. She gave recommendations for the city and was super responsive to requests we had during the stay.
